(2015) presents a thoughtful exploration into the links between action words and emotional states using a categorical approach. While the paper discusses significant findings regarding how affective knowledge may ground word meanings, there are several critical points worth noting:\n\n1. **Methodological Strengths and Considerations**: The use of a feature generation task in Study 1 to identify action words associated with basic emotions is a solid methodological choice. However, the paper would benefit from a more detailed exploration of the potential limitations associated with this approach. For instance, participant bias in generation tasks could lead to idiosyncratic responses. Moreover, the influence of cultural background on how individuals associate words with emotions is minimally discussed but is crucial for generalizability.\n\n2. **Validation of Action-Word Associations**: The validation task in Study 2 is a commendable addition, effectively showcasing that typical word-emotion pairings led to stronger associative ratings than atypical ones. Nonetheless, the study's reliance on participants self-rating their associations may be influenced by previous exposure or expectations from Study 1. In future research, employing an independent group to rate these associations could reinforce the validity of the findings.\n\n3. **Implications for Theoretical Frameworks**: This study contributes to the discussion of how action words may evoke affective knowledge, aligning with situated conceptualizations of meaning. However, the interplay between categorical ratings and existing dimensional measures (valence and arousal) deserves further investigation. Currently, the conclusions on how categorical ratings can complement dimensional measures feel underdeveloped; additional analyses on the practical implications of these findings for emotional language processing would strengthen the theoretical contributions of the paper.\n\n**Comments**:\n- Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of how action words are grounded in affective knowledge and relates to emotional contexts.

However, while the ecological implications are intriguing, further studies that can establish direct interactions between archaeal viruses and their hosts (e.g., using metagenomic sequencing alongside single-cell genomics or CRISPR array studies) would provide deeper insights. Additionally, expanding the dataset to include regions beyond the ETNP could offer a broader perspective on archaeal viruses in diverse marine environments.", "10.7717/peerj.1415": "**Peer Review of \"Testing the enemy release hypothesis in a native insect species with an expanding range\" by Julia J. Mlynarek**\n\n**General Comments:**\nThe paper presents an interesting study on the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) as it applies to a native damselfly species, Enallagma clausum, which is experiencing a range expansion. The investigation stands out as it shifts the focus from invasive species, where the ERH has been predominantly studied, to native species adapting to new environments. While the study is thought-provoking and adds to our understanding of host-parasite interactions, a few points warrant further attention.\n\n**1. Methodological Rigor:**\nThe methods section is well-structured and clearly describes the process of collecting and examining damselflies. However, more detail could be provided regarding the statistical analyses employed, particularly concerning why specific models were chosen and if any assumptions for the ANOVAs were tested prior to analysis. Furthermore, detailed information on how the sampling strategy accounted for potential confounding variables (e.g., environmental factors at old vs. new sites) would strengthen the study's robustness.\n\n**2. Interpretation of Results:**\nMlynarek's results suggest that E. clausum does not benefit from reduced parasitism in new habitats, contradicting the ERH. The author posits that this may stem from the rapid adaptation of parasites to exploit the new host. However, this conclusion could be reinforced by considering alternative parasites\u2019 life histories and exploring whether they could exhibit different patterns of adaptation and host selection. Comparative treatments of specific parasite species (rather than pooled morpho-groups) might reveal more nuanced interactions in this context.\n\n**3. Discussion of Broader Implications:**\nThe discussion touches on significant evolutionary theories, such as Darwin's Naturalization Hypothesis and Host-Shifts. However, the implications of the findings could be elaborated further. For instance, the potential long-term impacts on E. clausum and E. boreale populations in terms of competition and fitness in the face of changing environmental dynamics could be insightful, especially with continued habitat changes due to climate shifts.\n\n**Comments:**\nOverall, this study fulfills an important niche in ecology by investigating the ERH in native species.

Jernigan and Seth R. Bordenstein**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe study provides a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and incidence of tandem-repeat protein domains\u2014specifically armadillo (ARM), tetratricopeptide (TPR), and ankyrin (ANK) domains\u2014across various organisms. The authors utilize data from the SUPERFAMILY database to assess the presence of these repeated domains throughout the three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), discussing their implications on organismal lifestyle and phylogeny.\n\n**Points of Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Robustness of Methodology:**\n   The authors employed a systematic approach by utilizing a large-scale protein domain database (SUPERFAMILY) and a well-defined methodology for gathering and analyzing protein domain data. Their criteria for inclusion\u2014focusing on the presence of at least one specific repeat domain in the proteomes analyzed\u2014strengthens the reliability of their findings. However, they should further address the limitations and potential biases in their data, particularly behind underrepresented taxa like the Mollicutes, which appeared consistently in their analysis.\n\n2. **Comparative Insights:**\n   The comparative analysis between the three tandem-repeat domains (TPR, ARM, ANK) effectively reveals interesting trends in taxa distribution and abundance relative to lifestyle and phylogenetic relationships. The conclusion that TPR domains are predominantly found in bacteria while eukaryotes have a greater abundance of ARM and ANK proteins is particularly noteworthy. This observation has implications for understanding the evolutionary pressures that shape protein domain utilization across different life forms. However, further exploration into the evolutionary significance of these findings\u2014especially in the context of horizontal gene transfer and adaptive function\u2014would enhance the discussion.\n\n3. **Interpretation of Results:**\n   The authors present compelling data suggesting that TPR and ARM domains are not significantly enriched in pathogenic bacteria, challenging existing assumptions about their roles in virulence. This new perspective raises questions about the specific biological functions of these tandem repeat proteins. Nevertheless, a more extensive discussion on the functional roles of these domains in different contexts or environments\u2014beyond mere presence/absence\u2014would provide a richer understanding of the implications of their findings.\n\n**Comments:**\nWhile the analysis presents well-articulated insights into the prevalence of tandem-repeat domains across life forms, enhancing the discussion with further functional implications of these domains in specific ecological or evolutionary contexts would strengthen the overall contribution of this study. Additionally, an exploration of the potential for repeat domains to inform biological function and evolutionary adaptation would provide valuable depth to the conclusions drawn.

The paper presents important findings relevant to ecology, entomology, and toxicology. Below are three points that highlight both strengths and areas for improvement in the manuscript:\n\n1. **Robust Experimental Design**: The authors employed both field surveys and controlled laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects of tire leachate. This dual approach effectively demonstrates the relationship between environmental conditions (e.g., zinc concentrations in tires) and mosquito population dynamics. The statistical analyses used, particularly the negative binomial regressions and randomization ANOVAs, are appropriate for addressing the research questions and provide a solid basis for the authors' conclusions about the differential impact of tire leachate on the two mosquito species.\n\n2. **Significant Findings with Implications**: The study's findings reveal that A. albopictus exhibits greater tolerance to tire leachate than A. triseriatus, which could have larger ecological implications regarding the dynamics between invasive and native species in urban settings. This insight is particularly valuable in the context of pest control and vector management, as it suggests that the prevalence of A. albopictus could be exacerbated in environments with higher concentrations of tire leachate. Furthermore, the correlation between higher zinc levels and reduced A. triseriatus populations raises concerns about biodiversity loss in these habitats and warrants further investigation into management practices for tire disposal.\n\n3. **Limited Exploration of Mechanisms**: While the authors propose potential mechanisms for the observed differences in mosquito response to tire leachate, such as microbial resource changes and direct toxicity, they do not empirically test these hypotheses. Incorporating additional experiments that explore the biochemical and ecological mechanisms by which tire leachate affects larval survival and development\u2014particularly focusing on microbial dynamics or toxicological assays\u2014would strengthen the manuscript and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes.\n\n**Comments**: \nThe manuscript is generally well-written and presents a compelling argument supported by empirical data. However, it would benefit from editing for clarity and conciseness in areas where technical jargon or complex sentences may obscure key findings. Additionally, further contextualization of the findings within current literature on environmental toxins' impact on mosquito populations could enhance the discussion.

Study Design and Methodology:**\nThe methodology employed in this study is robust and well-structured, utilizing a dichotomous choice apparatus to assess the spatial learning skills of juvenile mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) based on their stress profiles. The classification of fish into low and high-stress categories using background cortisol levels is a strength, as it provides a clear physiological marker underpinning behavioral differences. However, the study could be enhanced by incorporating additional behavioral metrics or environmental enrichments that might influence learning outcomes. For example, it would be beneficial to understand if factors such as social dynamics within the learning environment could further elucidate the learning approach differences observed.\n\n**2. Results Interpretation:**\nThe results provide compelling evidence that low-stress fish exhibit higher activity levels and improved learning performance compared to high-stress counterparts. This distinction, connecting cortisol levels with learning efficiency and activity, adds significant value to the broader understanding of stress and personality interactions in marine fish. Nevertheless, the paper primarily attributes differences in learning speed to coping style without adequately discussing potential confounding factors. For instance, exploring the impact of individual size variations or prior experience with similar tasks could further strengthen the findings. A more nuanced discussion on the implications of the findings for aquaculture management practices would enhance the relevance of the research.\n\n**3. Implications and Applications:**\nThe implications of this study are significant for aquaculture and fisheries management, suggesting that individual differences in stress coping styles might influence learning and adaptation in captive environments. The idea of potentially selectively breeding for stress responsiveness traits holds great promise but requires careful consideration of the ecological consequences and ethical dimensions of such interventions. Further research could focus on the long-term effects of contingent selection on fish populations and their welfare in captive settings.\n\n**Comments:**\nOverall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the intersection of animal behavior, stress physiology, and aquaculture science. However, there is room for improvement in addressing potential confounding variables and expanding the discussion on future research directions and practical applications.

Reno and C. Owen Lovejoy**\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis paper represents a significant contribution to our understanding of sexual dimorphism in *Australopithecus afarensis*, particularly through its methodological advancements and in the context of existing theories. Below are three key points that warrant attention:\n\n1. **Methodological Innovations**: The authors introduce and compare two novel methods\u2014Template Method (TM) and Geometric Mean Method (GMM)\u2014for estimating sexual dimorphism from postcranial fossil assemblages. This dual approach enhances the robustness of their analysis. The TM validates previous findings and addresses the issues related to sample bias, while the GMM sheds light on the implications of how metrics are aggregated. The careful investigation of how specimen representation influences dimorphism outcomes is commendable and provides clarity in understanding the significant differences between methods.\n\n2. **Results Interpretation**: The authors convincingly argue that the moderate level of skeletal dimorphism indicated by their findings is comparable to that of modern humans and does not support the view that *A. afarensis* was highly dimorphic as previously posited. By incorporating additional specimens like KSD-VP-1/1 (\"Kadanuumuu\"), they effectively refute claims of extensive sexual dimorphism, steering the discussion towards the influence of sample size and specimen selection on these estimates. The insights derived from this comprehensive analysis challenge previous perceptions and potentially reshape existing hypotheses regarding social and reproductive behaviors in *A. afarensis*.\n\n3. **Implications for Hominid Evolution**: The exploration of dimorphism not only informs the morphology of *A. afarensis* but also places this species within a broader evolutionary context, especially when compared to other primates. The findings suggest a less aggressive reproductive strategy that echoes characteristics seen in humans and chimps rather than gorillas. Such interpretations help build a more nuanced understanding of early hominid social structures and reproductive behaviors, corroborating current theories on human evolution.\n\n**Comments:**\nWhile the study is robust and the findings significant, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion on the potential limitations of the sample sizes and the representativeness of the skeletal metrics used. Moreover, a deeper exploration into the evolutionary implications of their findings beyond the immediate context of *A. afarensis* could further enrich the discourse on sexual dimorphism in hominids and its potential influences on social evolution.

The research raises interesting implications for understanding how expertise can shape cognitive processes in athletes. However, there are several points worthy of consideration.\n\n1. **Methodological Rigor**: The study's methodology, including the selection of participants and the task administration, is sound. Nonetheless, the authors should clarify how they controlled for potential confounding variables, such as individual differences in baseline cognitive abilities or additional physical training outside of martial arts. Given that the sample reportedly had similar scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale and TOVA, additional details about the recruitment and screening process would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the findings.\n\n2. **Operationalization of Attention**: While the authors focus on sustained attention measured via ERP components (P100, P200, N200, and P300), the interpretation of these components could benefit from deeper engagement with existing literature. The specific relationships between the observed ERP components and distinct cognitive processes (e.g., detection vs. evaluation) should be explicitly outlined, supported by relevant references, to build a compelling argument linking ERP findings to sustained attention in the context of combat sports.\n\n3. **Interpretation of Results**: The discussion of results points towards the greater neural efficiency in skilled athletes; however, the comments on \"Neural Flexibility\" could be misleading without empirical support. Given that the study found no behavioral differences and the authors suggest a potential explanatory factor of intelligent impulse control among athletes, it would be beneficial to address whether cognitive performance metrics (beyond ERP) could correlate with neural measures in future studies. This will provide a more nuanced understanding of how skill level interacts with cognitive processing.\n\n**Comments**: \nOverall, this paper presents significant contributions to the understanding of cognitive processes in martial arts athletes. The findings suggest intriguing implications for training practices aimed at improving attentional skills in novices. Future studies could expand further into potential interventions that combine both physical and cognitive training to optimize performance in martial arts and other sports.

The study is well-situated within the broader context of evolutionary and conservation ecology, addressing significant themes related to migration, local adaptation, and population dynamics. Below are three thorough points concerning the strengths and potential limitations of this work:\n\n1. **Robust Methodological Framework**: The authors developed a detailed genetic and demographic model that incorporates various ecological and evolutionary factors influencing genetic structure. This modeling approach allows for the isolation and analysis of persistent founder effects, local adaptation, and the role of diapausing egg banks. The use of Monte-Carlo simulations across a range of realistic parameter values effectively demonstrates the interplay between these factors, thus providing valuable insights. However, the complexity of the model could benefit from a more extensive validation against empirical data to strengthen its predictive power and applicability to natural populations.\n\n2. **Insightful Conclusions on Local Adaptation**: One of the notable findings of the study is the limited impact of local adaptation on genetic structure within larger populations, contrary to what might be expected. This suggests that while local adaptation is occurring, it may not be the driving factor in the genetic differentiation of passively dispersed aquatic invertebrates. The manuscript effectively links this finding back to empirical observations in the literature, which supports the authors\u2019 conclusions. Further, the discussion of how these effects may differ between taxonomic groups, such as rotifers and cladocerans, is a significant contribution to understanding evolutionary dynamics in freshwater ecosystems.\n\n3. **Consideration of Delimiting Factors**: The authors rightly highlight that factors such as population size and the presence of diapausing egg banks have a strong influence on persistent founder effects and genetic drift. The clear articulation of how these demographic features contribute to the genetic outcomes provides a nuanced view that can guide future empirical studies. Nonetheless, the paper could be improved by discussing potential limitations of the model parameters, including assumptions about genetic linkage and selection, which may not fully represent the diversity of scenarios encountered in natural populations.\n\n**Comments:**\n- While the manuscript is well-structured and the findings are robust, the authors should consider including a more detailed discussion of how their results can inform conservation efforts for aquatic invertebrates, particularly in light of habitat changes and climate impacts. Additionally, enhancing the clarity regarding how diapausing egg banks function in varying environmental contexts could aid readers in applying the findings to practical conservation strategies.

However, while the literature search and subsequent analysis are thorough, the rationale for the selection criteria of specific papers could be better articulated to enhance the understandability of the review process. Including further justification regarding the choice of key studies would strengthen the manuscript.\n\n**2. Methodology and Data Collection:**\nThe survey methodology provides a useful complement to the literature review, allowing for firsthand insights from entomologists globally. However, the relatively low response rate (15.6%) raises concerns regarding the representativeness of the data collected. A discussion on potential biases in the survey results, such as non-response bias and the implications this may have on the findings, should be included to contextualize the data appropriately.\n\n**3. Implications for Conservation and Policy:**\nThe paper successfully highlights the invasive nature of *Harmonia axyridis* and discusses its potential threats to native biodiversity. The suggestions for strict policies to manage its spread are timely and relevant. However, the authors could enhance the impact of their conclusions by specifying which particular policies or management strategies they propose or advocating for interdisciplinary collaborations that involve not just ecologists but also policymakers, economists, and local communities.\n\n**Comments Section:**\nOverall, this manuscript raises a critical awareness regarding the potential unintended consequences of utilizing biocontrol agents such as *Harmonia axyridis*. Yet, I would encourage the authors to delve deeper into the regional case studies or examples where such biocontrol practices have either succeeded or failed. This could provide a more nuanced understanding of the broader ecological implications and inform better future management strategies. Additionally, enhancing the discussion surrounding the practical challenges of implementing proposed strict policies in different socio-political contexts would add depth to the conclusions.", "10.7717/peerj.1301": "**Review of \"Spider crabs of the Western Atlantic with special reference to fossil and some modern Mithracidae\"**\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive examination of spider crabs in the Western Atlantic, providing both historical and taxonomic insights into the family Mithracidae. The authors significantly contribute to the field through meticulous research and analysis, focusing on fossil records alongside modern taxa. Below are three thorough points regarding the strengths and areas for further improvement in the paper:\n\n1. **Thorough Examination of Fossil Records**: The authors provide an extensive review of the fossil record of spider crabs, offering insights into their evolutionary history. Notably, by determining the first appearance of spider crabs in the Late Cretaceous and their diversification in the Miocene, the study successfully contextualizes their biogeographical evolution in the Western Atlantic. This analysis is bolstered by the substantial data presented in tables and figures, which enhance the clarity of the distribution and diversity of these species over time.\n\n2. **New Taxonomic Insights**: The establishment of new genera, such as Maguimithrax, and the description of new species, such as Mithrax arawakum and Nemausa windsorae, are commendable contributions to taxonomic and systematic paleontology. These descriptions are grounded in extensive morphological analysis and well-defined criteria, contributing to a more refined understanding of Mithracidae systematics. However, the paper could benefit from additional molecular phylogenetic data to support the morphological findings, which would solidify the taxonomic placements.\n\n3. **Discussion of Allometric Growth**: The exploration of allometric growth in spider crabs is an essential aspect of the paper. The authors quantitatively show how length/width ratios change with growth stages, an important factor often overlooked in crustacean studies. This aspect not only enhances the understanding of morphological changes but also raises awareness of potential implications for intraspecific variation and sexual dimorphism among fossils and extant species.\n\n**Comments**: \nWhile the paper provides robust research and valuable findings, it could improve by integrating molecular data to complement the morphological analyses presented. In addition, a more focused discussion on the ecological implications of the findings could enhance the paper's significance in understanding the role of spider crabs in past marine ecosystems. Overall, the paper is a noteworthy contribution to the fields of paleontology and marine biodiversity."}
