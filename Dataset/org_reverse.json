Although the authors present interesting findings, several aspects need further clarification and improvement.\n\n**Points of Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Methodological Rigor and Sample Size:**\n   The authors conducted a case-control study involving 91 COPD patients and 88 controls. However, the relatively small sample size limits the statistical power of the findings. Additionally, the authors suggest longer TL in controls but do not provide a power analysis to justify the sample size chosen for detecting differences. Future studies should aim for larger cohorts to enhance the robustness of the conclusions drawn.\n\n2. **Statistical Analysis and Significance:**\n   The study reports that while patients have shorter TL compared to controls, the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.137). However, the results highlight a negative correlation between BMI and TL in controls, which, despite being marginally significant (p = 0.076), could provide valuable insights into confounding factors influencing TL. A deeper exploration of potential confounders and their interactions could enhance the reliability of the conclusions drawn, particularly in light of the noted variations in TL according to BMI and age.\n\n3. **Association between SNPs and Telomere Length:**\n   The authors conclude that the SNPs rs12696304 and rs10936599 are associated with COPD risk but do not correlate with TL. While the separation of these two mechanisms is intriguing, it is essential to discuss the biological implications of this finding in greater depth. How might these SNPs influence COPD risk independent of TL? A more thorough examination of the pathways through which SNPs impact the disease process could strengthen the manuscript's contribution to the field.\n\n**Comments:**\nThe paper presents a valuable contribution to understanding the relationship between genetic factors and COPD. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of their small sample size, providing a more detailed analysis of the statistical findings, and discussing the biological pathways that connect the SNPs investigated with COPD susceptibility. Addressing these points would significantly improve the clarity and impact of their findings.", "12454": "### Peer Review\n\n#### Summary\nThis study investigates the transcriptomic complexity of tail fat in sheep, focusing on the role of post-transcriptional modifications, specifically alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA), as well as identifying differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between thin-tailed and fat-tailed sheep.

They utilize transgenic parasites modified with glmS riboswitches to regulate PfDHS expression and assess the implications for parasite growth and protein synthesis. The results suggest that PfDHS is essential, although less vulnerable as a drug target compared to other essential genes.\n\n**Points of Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Experimental Design and Methodology:**\n   The use of transgenic *P. falciparum* parasites to investigate the function of PfDHS through targeted expression modulation is robust. The inclusion of both Western blotting and confocal microscopy effectively demonstrates the successful tagging and localization of the PfDHS protein. However, the study would benefit from a clearer explanation of controls used in competitive growth assays. Specifying the number of replicates and addressing any technical variations between experiments would enhance reproducibility and confidence in the results.\n\n2. **Interpretation of Results:**\n   The authors correlate the reduction in PfDHS expression with a growth defect in *P. falciparum*, which aligns with the essentiality hypothesis of the gene. However, the slow decline in PfDHS attenuated parasites raises questions regarding the minimal functional threshold for hypusinated eIF5A. A more comprehensive exploration of how residual PfDHS function affects specific essential proteins and downstream processes may clarify the mechanistic details. Additionally, a comparative analysis with other essential genes regarding their vulnerability to drug targeting would substantiate claims about PfDHS being a less favorable target.\n\n3. **Computational and Structural Modeling:**\n   The in silico modeling of PfDHS provides meaningful insights into potential ligand binding sites and their conservation in relation to human DHS. While the identification of a secondary binding site is promising for drug design, the authors should provide a more in-depth discussion on how this may influence the specificity and efficacy of potential inhibitors. Further validation of the model through experimental means, such as site-directed mutagenesis, could strengthen the conclusions about structural conservation and inhibitor design.\n\n**Comments Section:**\nThe manuscript provides valuable insights into the function of PfDHS while highlighting the potential for novel antimalarial drug development. However, the study would benefit from additional emphasis on controls and statistical analyses to fortify claims about essentiality and target vulnerability. Clarifying these aspects will make the findings more robust and applicable to the broader context of antimalarial drug development. Overall, the research is a significant contribution to understanding the role of hypusination in malaria biology and the utilization of PfDHS as a potential drug target.", "11940": "**Peer-Review of the Paper on Food-Sourced Vitamins**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe paper provides a comprehensive perspective review on food-sourced vitamins, addressing various aspects such as classification, absorption, metabolic functions, deficiencies, and their implications for human health.
