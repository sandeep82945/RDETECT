Comments:The authors performed a historical reanalysis of the data to describe the spatiotemporal patterns of the 1978&#8211;84 anthrax epidemic in Rhodesia. They have explored the spatial distribution dynamics of the anthrax outbreaks in humans from November 1978 to October 1980, and revealed the evaluated geographic involvement and numbers of human and cattle cases. In general, this study contains helpful information to understand the epidemiological features of this epidemic of anthrax in Rhodesia, and could give a clue to future studies on the etiology of this epidemic. My major comments: (1) It is not clear how data were collected and processed in the Materials and Methods section, and maybe the literatures needed to be cited here according to their categories such as historical (pre-epidemic) data, route of infection, severity of disease, meteorological data and seasonality, host animals, potential vectors, and vaccination coverage.(2) Geospatial analysis needs to be described in more detail, e.g., How to identify an &#8220;outbreak&#8221; (how many cases)? How to conduct the analysis if two or more epidemic waves occurred in a hospital? The mean of outbreak coordinates seems not fitting for sporadic outbreaks in a wide area, maybe the map series of number of cases for each month or three months are optional.       Minor comments:(1) Lines 124-125: No human or bovine anthrax cases were reported in all of Rhodesia from 1972 to 1977. However, it seems human cases were reported and displayed in the Figure 1 and limited outbreaks in bovines or humans were reported in &#8220;Mhondoro Tribal Trust Land (1974)&#8221; (Lines 120-121 ). Please check literatures and correct it.  (2) Lines 205-207: &#8220;Resource strain at the hospital was reflected in demand for hospitalizations, was noted in January 1980 and again in July 1980, which was the result of two waves of patients who were hospitalized for two to five weeks.&#8221; which is not consistent with Figure 6. (3)The name of each province needs to be displayed in Figure 7, which is helpful for checking the locations of them.

The authors current analysis does not support their conclusion of a geotemporal spread. The authors do not discuss how different climatic zones with latitudinal variation in precipitation may influence the timing of outbreaks. A hypothesis of the timing of anthrax outbreaks states the timing of outbreak is related to variation in precipitation patterns and temperature. While the authors provide national climatic data this is of little use given the small spatial scale used in the analysis.             Comments:This manuscript revisits an outbreak of anthrax, an important neglected zoonotic disease found nearly worldwide. The manuscript is interesting although there are several issues (methodological and others) that need to be addressed. The use of hospital locations for enumerating the spread of anthrax is problematic for several reasons: access to facilities is going to vary causing individuals, particularly those in rural agrarian occupations, to travel far distances to seek treatment, and individuals may not choose the closest hospital if they believe a better facility exists. Rather a better use is to identify the community of origin as the putative source of infection (likely not available). Regardless the use of data at this resolution does not support a geo-temporal spread of the disease. The etiological agent of anthrax was not confirmed until the 1880&#8217;s, so discussions of a lack of reporting dating back to the early 1800&#8217;s is erroneous. Anthrax to this date is severely underreported despite advances in diagnostic and surveillance. So it is likely that historical accounts of reporting in humans and particularly wildlife will be wildly inaccurate.

Most importantly the full verb generation data are provided in the appendix to stimulate future reseach. I would only like to ask the authors to also include a reference to the recent attempt by Westbury et al (2014) to generate quite similar data based on large text corpora, and discuss how this approach differs from the recent study.*Westbury, C., Keith, J., Briesemeister, B.

Still, it could be made clearer why synonyms were omitted (or merged) from the analyses?Also, i would like the authors to further validate their examination of the typicality effects, as in the present analyses, the data of 1 examplar is compare with the averaged data of five other associations (in study 2). This could likely have biased the results and it would be interesting to read whether a typicality effect is still visible when the typical and the highest atypical rating are compared? Or some data is provided that shows that the confidence interval of the mean rating of the atypical does not overlap with the ratings of the typical verbs...                 see above             Comments:see above            ", "The submission is self-contained, generally coherent and conforms to professional standards (although there are many typos that need to be corrected in revision).  Some essential details need to be expanded on, or clarified in the introduction/discussion:A general comment: It would be especially helpful to explain more clearly how script theory relates to theories of lexical representation and processing.  Especially as there are (suddenly) a number of views of lexical processing that take emotional content into account, mostly variants of the idea that words with emotional connotations evoke those emotions in the comprehender thus influencing lexical processing to some extent (some prominent authors taking these directions include Pexman, Pulvermuller, Vigliocco, Yap, and even the most recent incarnation of Paivio's dual-coding theory).  In particular, script theory seems to especially resonate with the idea that words' meanings depend deeply on various aspects of physical experience including perception, action and emotion (often couched in terms of conceptual features, such as that apples are red, hammers can be manipulated by holding with a single hand, and crying is evoked by sadness). Does script theory provide a more precise mechanism by which these links between language and emotion may affect processing of single words?In the introduction the authors especially argue for the importance of context in the comprehension/interpretation of emotional words, especially verbs. In particular, it is difficult/inappropriate to interpret typical ratings of words in terms of a decontextualised dimensional model (valence-arousal) and that context needs to be taken into account.  However I am not entirely convinced that collecting ratings of words' association with basic emotion terms is truly suitable for overcoming this concern. As the authors discuss elsewhere in the introduction (eg. lines 72+) effects for single words differ greatly depending on sentence context, undermining the present approach in which associations between single words (e.g. SADNESS - CRY) are taken as \"contextual\". And the sentences that are provided in study 2 (see line 285) provide very little context beyond the pairing of the two words in question: they are nearly semantically empty and constant across the items tested.  While this is necessary for experimental control, it weakens the argument that the present approach is suitably contextual.There is also some evidence that appears to support the dimensional model of emotion (e.g. Kuperman et al, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 2014; Kuperman, Quarterly Journal of Exp Psychology 2014) so it may be premature to reject this approach.  In my view such findings show that despite strong effects of sentence context (and other kinds of contexts), there remain some strong, reliable patterns of emotion in lexical processing even when single words are rated in a decontextualised manner - or presented out of context in a single-word experiment.  Minor points:Lines 43-47: the authors mention that 44.54% of words were strongly related to one or more discrete emotion labels in Stevenson et al (2007). Can it be clarified what kind of criterion was used here?  It's not obvious from Stevenson et al what this was - and how it relates to the idea that discrete emotion categories are useful for providing specific contexts?   Verbs vs action words: it's also important to take note that not all action words are verbs: action nouns exist and tend to have extremely similar semantic makeup to their verb counterparts.                 Methods are described appropriately, with sufficient level of detail throughout and in line with ethical standards.                 The authors used a highly constrained paired-associate generation task (Basic emotion word -&gt; Verb). how does this differ from unconstrained free association as in Nelson et al (2004)?  Also relevant in this regard is semantic feature generation: see Buchanan et al (Behavior Research Methods 2013) in which several of the terms used here are employed in an unrestricted semantic feature generation task --- typically corresponding to the patterns observed in the present Study 1 which I think provides further, if indirect, validation of the present approach.The authors seem to go back and forth in discussing \"discrete\" emotions vs. their overlap.  Sometimes this is discussed as a strong distinction, but other times as a matter of degree.  For example, in some places the fact that individual words appear across multiple basic emotions is taken as evidence that they should be considered as homonyms: different words that happen to have the same form (the case of \"jump\" on lines 194+) but in other places a different approach is taken (the case of \"cry\" which does not seem to attract similar treatment despite being produced regularly for multiple basic emotions).  First of all, I would like more information about the criteria for cases that were merged vs. unmerged (like JUMP), and how frequently this occurred. And secondly, are cases like \"cry\" problematic for the idea that basic emotions are discrete?  This issue is relevant across the manuscript: the introduction, decisions made in data modifications (study 1) and the interpretation of the results, and I think the authors need to be more explicit about it.One very important decision the authors made, was to combine synonyms in study 1 (starting about lines 186).  I am worried about this procedure, especially if one of the aims is to provide normative materials that can be used in future studies.  If production of \"shout\" + \"yell\" is combined into a single case, it seems to me that the production frequency of \"shout\" will be an overestimate of the link between a basic emotion like ANGER and the specific word \"shout\".  This is especially problematic for the next example provided: cases like \"laugh\" + \"giggle\" treated as synonymous based on thesaurus co-occurrence in both directions.  Consulting this particular source (dictionary.cambridge.org) it appears that laughing and smiling are combined into a set of \"synonyms, related words and phrases that make up this topic.\"  I would prefer that these decisions are checked and confirmed using a more conventional thesaurus that does not also include related words.  These seem to be especially made up of cases where a more specific term (subordinate/troponym) is combined with its superordinate/hypernym, which implies some important assumptions about the categorical structure of verbs.I also noticed that a very large number of responses were idiosyncratic, nearly 70% of the responses that were deemed acceptable according to the exclusion criteria. This seems like a wealth of data that could be potentially useful - as a vetted set of verbs that meet the criteria for selection.  I suggest that this list is provided as additional supplemental materials.For Study 2, the design is highly appropriate to serve as validation of the results from Study 1: mainly the overall consistently high ratings for the most typical verb-emotion pairing.I am particularly interested in the apparent variability among the atypical items. If these verbs were truly diagnostic of a particular emotion, or at least extremely associated with it, I might have expected them to be at floor when rated for other emotions.  After all, the very top word for each emotion was selected from study 1. This is especially the case for surprise and fear, for which the mean of all five \"atypical\" verbs is greater than 3, the midpoint of the 1-5 rating scale.  Is this problematic for a neatly discrete account of emotions and associated verbs?Minor points:Line 128-129 The association task used in study 1 differs importantly from the feature generation methods used by Cree &amp; McRae (2003) and Vigliocco et al (2004) - both explicitly instructed participants to avoid free associations.Line 172: The study was conducted online and participants were \"discouraged from using the internet\" to do the task. Is there any way of ruling out this possibility - if they did it anyway, it would very significantly undermine the validity of the study.  I think the authors can/should defend themselves against this possibility: diversity of responses across participants suggests this was not a common problem, and the validation provided by study 2 further supports this.Line 182: \"confused\" is mentioned as a case that should be excluded as a synonym for the emotion label itself.  Which emotion label is \"confused\" a synonym of?  (perhaps the wrong example was mentioned here - I think \"confused\" fits under exclusion criterion (a) as it's far more likely to be an adjective rather than a past-tense verb).Lines 252-254: this seems very vague, can the authors make this more specific?Lines 290-294: it would be useful to discuss the difference between forward and backward associations in terms of conditional probabilities. This is especially important given the differences in directionality that were observed for sadness/fear and which are not very clearly discussed (lines 438-453): for example the propensity to hide when expressing fear may vary depending on the type of stimulus causing fear, but that given behaviour of hiding, likelihood that a person is experiencing fear is much greater: P(Hide|Fear) &lt; P(Fear|Hide).Line 382: What is meant by \"summed atypical pairings\"?

The authors first test the use of this script on publicly available data, and then apply it to new data (marine viromes from two sites) to identify novel archaeal virus contigs and relate these to the prokaryotic community structure and other environmental parameters at the two marine stations.

I have made many stylistic suggestions for the author.  The final grammar and construction are the purview of the author, of course, but I encourage the author to consider my suggestions.                 This study addresses a classic ecological hypothesis in a straightforward way, with an appropriate experiment and appropriate statistical analyses.                 I have a couple more significant methodological points.  First, each site was sampled only twice, and all sites were sampled during the same 2-week period in July.  Given that the sites are so widely separated, isn&#8217;t it likely that the sites are at different points during the population cycles of the mites? The J site, for instance, is at much lower latitude and might be &#8220;further along into summer&#8221; than the other sites &#8211; perhaps reflected in the generally higher levels of parasitism at this site compared to the others.  Likewise, are the three new sites in Alberta at higher elevations than those in Sask?  It just seems that, since the sampling was done over such a short period but over such a large geographical area, that differences both between and within &#8220;site&#8221; categories could be affected by differences in phenology. Second, pooling all mites and gregarines is a significant methodological choice that needs to be addressed.  The author states that pooling was justified because species within a parasite type have the same effect on the host.  Although they do, I don&#8217;t think this is the issue.  Although two mite species both have the same physiological effect on a host (sucking hemolymph), it seems possible that the host may be able to mount an immunological response against one and not the other.  It is possible that a na&#239;ve species might be susceptible to one resident mite species but not another, and these patterns are confounded by pooling all mite species.  Pooling might be justified on other grounds: mites are typically generalist species, and so SHOULD be able to exploit closely related hosts.  Multiple generalist mite species might be considered as an &#8220;ecological species&#8221; not because they have the same affect, but because they are generalists that should be able to exploit the same species.  If they don&#8217;t, as a pooled group, then something else is happening &#8211; like a host being differentially susceptible to one or all of the mite species.  Pooling parasites is a methodological necessity for studies conducted over several sites with large samples of hosts; I have done it, myself.  But while it is a necessary convenience, the potential confounding effects of this choice should be considered explicitly&#8230; especially given the POPULATIONAL specificity that the author is trying to test here.  The ERH assumes that populations of the same parasites will have adapted differently to different hosts.  Surely the possibility that different species might adapt differently to different hosts, and might be at different densities in such widely spaced sites, and thereby create confounding problems when pooled, needs to be addressed as a caveat in the discussion.             Comments:This is an appropriate study of an ecologically interesting hypothesis. The methods and analyses are sound, but the short sampling window and the pooling of parasites create some possible confounding effects that need to be alluded to, at least.  But this is a valuable large-scale survey of parasitism in two congeners.

The word is enclosed by inverted commas in the title and is a practice that should be continued throughout the body of work. I have no further comments to add to their Basic Reporting as are very well structured and of publication quality.                 The authors identify a significant gap in palaeoichnology, that is how to obtain track data that can be utilised in quantitative comparative studies (albeit in a series of paired analyses). They succeed in their approach by utilising the powerful, innovative, and newly developed DigTrace software. The authors provide a series of case studies that are relevant for the application of the method, by which the findings are very clearly documented. This approach is of very high significance for this research field (particularly dinosaur tracks, and is one that I am confident that progressive palaeoichnologist are/will be eager to employ. As clearly stated by the authors, this is not a methods paper. The aim of the paper is to introduce &#8216;mediotype&#8217; as a term for use by the wider palaeoichnological community to incorporate as range of &#8216;statistically-generated three-dimensional track models [SG3D]&#8217;. While &#8217;mediotype&#8217; is a pleasant term that is simply to use, I do not think the term will be received unfavourably by palaeoichnologists for the following reasons :\t&#8226;\tEtymology implies a type specimen: &#8216;Mediotype&#8217; adds to now a growing list of ICZN non-formalised terms (e.g., &#8216;digitype&#8217;, &#8216;plastotype&#8217;). Issues of repositories and accessibility to &#8216;type&#8217; specimens will also come into play. Line 423 \"unlike conventional palaeontology finding a 'morphologically-perfect' specimen is almost impossible\" I am of the opinion that there will be strong resistance for the digital construction of an 'ideal' by any means. The authors \"argue that the use of 3D data may assist in correcting this omission\" which may be appropriate in for analyses but I disagree that type specimens should be a chimera of track data, nor would this be acceptable for type specimens for other research fields.\t&#8226;\tEtymology implies &#8216;averaging&#8217; of data: In practice, &#8216;average&#8217; data sets (mean, median) appear to be the preferred documentation source for use in this paper (supplied figures, raw data). While I am in agreement that such track data are perhaps the most useful data sets for palaeoichnologists, the fact that their term encapsulates non-averaging statistical data makes use of the term non-inclusive and potentially misleading.\t&#8226;\tImplies a single specimen: Even &#8216;digitype&#8217; and &#8216;plastotype&#8217; inferred specimens limited themselves to single representation. &#8216;Mediotype&#8217; include six csv file types are generated with the DigTrace software (mean, median, maximum differences, minimum differences, standard deviation, point-to-point comparisons) most of which are not elaborated further after their mention in the paper. \t&#8226;\tImplies that only type specimens can be used in the generation of SG3D track data whereby limiting application (e.g., just as &#8216;digitype&#8217; is limited to type specimens), a restriction that is almost certainly not the intention of the authors.                 The placement of landmarks can be problematic for tracks that are, by their very nature, highly variable abiotic structures. Although While the software the authors show preferences for using (Digtrace) displays significant robustness around this issue.One aspects that is confusing it the greyscale visualisation and interpretations of the standard deviation &#8216;mediotypes&#8217; shown in figures 1D, F; 5C; 6B, D. Here, white indicates low deviation and black indicates high deviation. Yet in each example that the authors state in-text that there is low deviation the plantar impressions are darker than the surrounding surface. In the example that the authors state in-text as high deviation (e.g., figure 6 B) most of the plantar impression is white and surrounding surface is darker. In these cases, the data contradicts the authors claim. This is particularly important to resolve as readers that become users of the Digtrace software may face the same issues.Otherwise very well structured.             Comments:This is an important, well-written paper for dinosaur palaeoichnology and has the potential to be a very positive and broad influence for future research in this field.  The use of the term 'mediotype' is with significant problems that can be resolved, for the most part, by substituting the non-ambiguous and more accurate term 'statistically-generated three-dimensional track model' (SG 3D) of 'statistically-generated digital surface model' (SG DSM).For further comments see attached annotated pdf.

Comments:Dear all,I should emphasize that I am conservative regarding the use of 3D imaging in vertebrate ichnology. Therefore I would probably be categorized a &#8218;traditionalist&#8216; following the terminology of the authors.  I do not refuse the application of 3D imaging in vertebrate ichnology, but I just do not see any use of hitherto suggested methods in order to solve the main problems of studying fossil tetrapod footprints.The morphology of tetrapod tracks is the result of the superimposition of anatomy, gait and substrate. A majority of vertebrate ichnologists prefers an ichnotaxonomy highlights anatomically-based characters of the imprint morphology and trackway pattern. Therefore, the main challenge to these researchers is to distinguish anatomical input of tracks and trackways from extramorphological characters (= influence of gait and substrate conditions).In which way a &#8218;mediotype&#8216; sensu Belvedere et al. may help anatomically-focused vertebrate ichnologists? As far as I understand the authors, the &#8218;mediotype&#8216; is mainly a tool to quantify the differences between two or more tracks. The result is a number which nothing helps to interpret the reason for the calculated difference(s). I definitely see that I could introduce tresholds such as a similarity index, e.g. two tracks should be similar by 90% in order to assign them to the same ichnospecies. However, I do not know how much of the similarity/dissimilarity is based on anatomy, gait, and substrate. Thus, where is the progress? I totally accept that the &#8218;mediotype&#8216; is one out of several tools for vertebrate ichnologists but I doubt that it has the potential to revolutionize this paleontological discipline.What to do with this manuscript? It may be worth to describe the &#8218;mediotype&#8216; method and its application as examplified by the authors. But I feel that the importance of the paper is overstated. My suggestions: I would go along with the proposal to introduce tetrapod ichnotaxa at the base of long and well-preserved trackways, only. Thus, the introduction of ichnotaxa (diagnosis, description, measurements of track and trackway parameters) could be completed by data from 3D imaging in a way that the similarity of tracks within each specimen of the type series is calculated separately. This might result in useful values for other workers who want to quantify the similarity of their own specimens to the type material. By calculating discrete specimens the authors avoid the accusation of arbitrary selection as they base their models (&#8218;mediotype&#8216;) on type specimens exclusively (that are used by &#8218;traditionalists&#8216; as well). I do not see any use to extend the data base of the &#8218;mediotype&#8216; beyond type material (according to the requirements on quality and quantity of new ichnotaxa). I think it would be a good paper to describe and illustrate the process of introduction a new ichnotaxa including a &#8218;mediotype&#8216; in most detail (documentation of the type material, traditional diagnosis, measurements, description, 3D model, &#8218;mediotype(s)&#8216; production). In addition, it would be helpful to apply the &#8218;mediotype&#8216; to similar specimens from another locality to examplify the tool. Certainly, my suggestions are not so far from the content of the author&#8217;s manuscript. However, I feel that the manuscript and its ideas would probably find more acceptance when the methods are demonstrated at a single example and in most detail. A good example would be Robledopus macdonaldi Voigt et al., 2013, small reptile tracks from the Early Permian oft he New Mexico as the ichnotaxon is based on a type series and there is ambiguous material from other localities of the same or similar age in New Mexcio.Finally, I welcome the idea of the &#8218;mediotype&#8216; if it will be restricted to type material. The authors should think about my suggestions to focus on a discrete and fully elaborated example. At the present stage, I do not see that the manuscript will be of much use to the vertebrate ichnology community.Sebastian Voigt2017-08-17                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.3078": ["The paper by Hao et al. seeks to pinpoint novel biomarkers for early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) via bioinformatic analysis of open source data.

DOI 10.1186/ar4526) were obtained from RA patients with medication (different types of drugs) at the moment of sampling (see article). Therefore, the inclusion criteria was not conducted in the way the authors say. 2)\tNo major conclusions were obtained from the Gene Ontology, PPI, TFs and Pathway analyses. The authors identified ontologies related to RNA splicing, signal transduction and gene expression, among other general terms. All this terms are expected when you are working with gene expression data. The GO terms are meant to give biological meaning to expression data and also lead or highlight the next experimental steps. However, the results obtained from GO and pathway say nothing relevant about the biology behind the expression signature obtained.3)\tThe main conclusion of this paper is that CD47, MAT2A and NSA2 are potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of RA. This observation was obtained from the analysis of top-ranked mRNAs in peripheral blood cells of patients with RA and controls. However, the analysis on peripheral blood cells showed that levels of NSA2 and CD47 are fairly similar between cases and controls and given that the authors did not even provide a statistical analysis it is not possible to conclude that there is a true difference in mRNAs levels. 4)\tImportantly, biomarkers should be related to the disease in a relevant manner. Synovial tissues are composed mainly by macrophage-like synovial cells and fibroblasts. Under inflammatory processes, such as RA, an increase in the immune infiltration may be seen. On contrary, peripheral blood cells are composed by myeloid and lymphocytic lineages. What it is the rationale of searching synovial tissue-derived mRNAs in blood cells?  How these genes are related to the biology of synovial tissues? What types of cells are expressing these mRNAs? For instance, LCK and TRD were the two top-ranked genes in synovial tissues. However, the expression of LCK is importantly reduced in peripheral blood cells. LCK and TRD are two genes strongly associated with T-cell lymphocytes, however, the authors did not address the biological relevance of finding both genes up-regulated in synovial tissues and LCK strongly down-regulated in peripheral blood cells.5)\tThe authors stated that these markers may be used for &#8220;early detection&#8221; of RA. All the datasets contained patients with a positive diagnostic of RA at the moment of sampling (an important proportion with medication). Early detection implies the identification of the disease in subjects without clinical symptoms, however, samples from subjects obtained prior to diagnostic were not included in this analysis.

By no means it is clear how the bioinformatic analysis of GO, pathways, PPI and TFs contribute to establish a rationale for the diagnosis of RA.

For example, the entire paragraph beginning from line 52 to 62. This is highlighted again in the following paragraph - lines 63-68. This hampers the comprehension of the text. Furthermore, I am concerned by the lack of the reporting of any genome wide association findings (GWAS) data in relation to RA. Instead the authors highlight case control studies - the first one cited being from a Slovakia population. Within the introduction, where the authors mention environmental risk factors it is again surprising that no mention is made either here, nor later in the discussion, of epistasis.                 The experimental design as presented is acceptable but the findings can at best be seen as preliminary. The authors provide no explanation as to why only GSE 17755 datasets have been utilised. Has ethnicity, gender, RA disease duration been controlled for within this dataset? The most significant weakness in the experimental design is the lack overall of any integration with any genetic information. In order for the TRANSFAC analysis to be meaningful this should have been aligned to replicated SNP loci co-segregating with the gene expression data.                 Whilst the findings may indeed be valid my concern is that these findings, as they stand, are highly preliminary and can therefore lead to a misdirection of the potential biomarkers. This  can be robustly addressed by factoring in data from replicated SNP loci.             Comments:Causal analysis through the utilisation of network approaches is an advantageous way forwards for understanding complex genetic diseases. The use of gene expression data sets coupled with the TRANSFAC approach is useful but limited in the way currently presented.

The species is described based on a single specimen; the authors should briefly discuss the problems associated with the low sample size of the description (e.g., sexual dimorphism, intraspecific variation). Also, I suggest adding a few sentences explaining why no additional specimens were included in the description... Is the species rare? Please describe the sampling effort at the type locality and nearby areas. Finally, add information about the conservation threats (if any) that the species might be facing.                                                ", "The authors describe a new species of Noblella from Southern Peru. The paper is well written and conforms to the &#8220;standard sections&#8221;. The authors used well referenced, actual and fundamental literature related to the subject. They present important new data on a very interesting and difficult group of direct developing frogs, however important information needed for the species description is limited or missing. These are discussed in the next section.                 While the manuscript has the potential to be published, I think that there are a number of serious concerns that preclude its consideration for publication in its current state.1. My main concern is that the description of the new species is based on only one specimen. While there are many cases when new species were described based on only one specimen it is important to address the problems associated to singleton descriptions (see Castroviejo-Fisher et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2012 and more recently Guayasamin et al. 2018). The authors fail to do this in the current manuscript. Almost no information concerning their field work is provided (when and how many times was the study site visited, methodology used etc.) and no details provided why they were not able to collect additional specimens (they just mention that the specimen was obtained during a &#8220;short survey&#8221; of the type locality - L 310). From personal experience I know how difficult it is to find the small frogs of the genus Noblella, but with regular visits (ideally in different seasons and weather conditions) is possible to collect a decent number of individuals needed for the description.This problem is especially severe as the new species seems very similar to the problematic type species of Noblella, N. peruviana, for which we lack any new data (molecular and morphological) as no additional specimens were found since the original description. The morphological differences found between the new species and N. peruviana don&#8217;t seem to be sufficient to separate them, considering the scarce information: old specimens on one hand (possibly even from different species; see De La Riva et al. 2008) and only one specimen on the other. By the way, how far from the putative type locality of N. peruviana (the vicinity of the Inca Mine, in Santo Domingo de Carabaya, De La Riva et al. 2008) was collected the N. thiuni specimen? I strongly recommend that the authors address these issues in their discussion.2. A second problem that I could identify is with the phylogenetic analysis. I understand that the authors didn&#8217;t try to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of this difficult group and their analysis is preliminary, but I still think that a robust analysis should be performed. I think that the used 16S sequences are not sufficient (especially for this group), and ideally inclusion of at least one nuclear gene would be desirable. Also, I would recommend the use of the primers 16SC and 16SD for the 16S gene as these are producing better quality sequences (more than 830 bp), in the case of Noblella, than the used 16Sar - 16Sbr pair. Additionally, I would recommend the use of a more versatile phylogenetic analysis tool like RAxML or Garli for the ML analysis (and with 1000 bootstrap replicates) and ideally coupled with a Bayesian inference in order to present a better resolved phylogenetic tree (as many groups had very low support in the authors Mega analysis). And finally and more importantly the authors don&#8217;t provide any information on the genetic distances of the closely related species. I recommend the inclusion of this data in the manuscript.                 I&#8217;m afraid that the authors don&#8217;t provide sufficient data to support the validity of the new species in the manuscripts current form, especially because the analyzed specimen is so similar to a controversial species. I would recommend the inclusion of additional specimens in their description and the rerun of the molecular analysis.

And I am unsure what the reader is supposed to get out of this outside of ocular patterns (?).  The paper interprets the plots but that seems rather subjective.  It may be good to do away with them and stick to model results only.  Further,  why do the X axis scales differ between years?  Maybe have a scale bar showing snow depth and temperature would help.                 I do not think the investigation was 'rigorous', according to my definition.  Reason being: 1) One camera, one site, 2 seasons of data 2) Use of explanatory variables singly or all together, and not in combinations. (so limited model sets).   Why not include all possible (and valid) combinations?  3) The ratios (e.g. doe:buck, doe:faun) should have a measure of error (standard error and CI's).  One way to get at this is found in \"Wildlife Demography: by Skalski et al. 2005. 4) The paper should explain why analyses were combined with a day variable.  I have ideas why but it would be better coming from the authors.  Also, interpretation of what this day variable means in the models as it was included in top models.  And, why day is in table 3 top models but not table 2?  5) Knowing which variables were correlated and what the total model included for all independent variables would be good. A table would suffice, with the threshold identified  (.5, .6, .7?)  6) The models, these are generalized linear models? Right?  Please be explicit here.   7) I get lost with the binary variables.  Here with the sentence \"We identified events as the day in which &gt; of rain or snow fell, where value of 1 indicated event on that day;0 otherwise\".  What are the events cataloged for?  These are separate binary variables for rain or snow on a day?Lastly, my assumption is most deer move through the underpass one way, and don't loiter in front of cameras.  So each count is likely to represent unique individuals.  This said, double counting individuals may not matter in these analyses, provided this doesn't happen unique to a sex or age class.  Perhaps state something to this effect, namely how \"most deer move through the underpass one way, and don't loiter in front of cameras, so each count is likely to represent unique animals\".  Then it's explicit.#1 above isn't going to change, outside of more effort.  My hunch is that the analyses are appropriate, but given some further information as suggested above will help determine for certain.                 I think the Results are valid, though as above clarifying the methods and reporting measures of error on the ratios will help.             Comments:This paper is short, concise and straightforward.  It's not going to rock anyone's world, but it will probably help game managers in this area anticipate migration through this underpass, and probably others in similar situations.  I think by clarifying the topics I brought up it will help make what was done clearer.  I intend all comments to be constructive.

These are a species rich and ecologically diverse group that warrants further study, both in terms of ecological adaptations and evolutionary diversification.  Detailed quantitative examination of the relationship between morphology and ecology in a broad sample of taxa is particularly important, and this study will likely be of use to a broad spectrum of scientists.I found the study to be interesting and enjoyed reading the manuscript.  The introduction does a good job introducing the group and the objectives of this study. The methods used were appropriate for this type of study, but more detail is needed on the samples used and the locomotives categories. In general, the results and discussion were good presented but there are a few portions that would be more appropriately presented in another part of the manuscript. The figures were particularly well done. This manuscript improves our understanding of the relationship between morphology and ecology in rodent and can help improve our understanding of their evolutionary history.My comments are summarized below.

First paragraph, could you please give some precision about the sample composition, (number of specimens, species and genera). All adult individuals?. Please indicate the authors that followed for osteological nomenclature.Line 117-130: Locomotory categories. I found the categories problematic.  Some of these categories  describe locomotor behavior or functional movements (&#8220;jumping&#8221;, &#8220;fossorial&#8221;), while others appear to just describe habitat (e.g. &#8220;terrestrial&#8221;, &#8220;arboreal&#8221;). I recommend that the taxa be recategorized with respect to locomotor behavior or behaviors that are likely to be associated directly with postcranial adaptations (e.g. jumping, quadrupedalism, climbing, digging, etc) not habitat. This makes more sense in terms of the stated goals of the paper. It is not clear to me why you have used the category semi-acuatic in quantitative analysis and not in qualitative analyses. If one of the purpose of the paper is to describe qualitatively both bones to define character states that best characterize the motion range of the ankle, and the favoured locomotor mode, then this point can not apply for the category semi-acuatic because they did not osteological description.Also, I would suggest including the definition of locomotor modes.Line 131-139. Why you have include11 species (16 specimenes) in qualitative analyses and 35 species (56 specimenes) in quantitative analysis?. If they all have astragalus and calcaneus why not provide information of the other genera in the qualitative analyses?. Perhaps you can include more representatives of each family and see better variation. If the idea was to include genera that represent the different locomotor types, please indicate this in the text of manuscript.Please indicate the authors that followed for measurement of astragalus and the calcaneus. Why these measurements were selected? (e.g. Importance functional). Perhaps the authors should add a table in the text with the osteological measurements.

Osteological descriptions: This part is long. Perhaps authors can make a general description of the astragalus and calcaneus by family and not by species. For example, make a general description of the structures of astragalus indicating the differences between species (e.g. the sustentacular and ectal facets are separated by wide sulcus, except in .....).  There are comments along the descriptions that should be presented in discussions. For example: line 250- 257; line 274-280; line 397-399; line 401-403.

The manuscript was well written overall, the introduction provides the necessary background for the study and the methods use a combination of qualitative dissections and quantitative analyses appropriate for characterization of how calcaneo-astragalar morphology reflects locomotion.

This study makes a significant contribution to understanding rodent ecomorphology and will likely be of use to a broad group of readers, including anatomists, paleontologists, and evolutionary biologists.

Page 23, line 601: The quantitative analysis results should start with a more generalized lead in statement.  Perhaps indicating that the LDA successfully separated locomotor groups based on astragalus and calcaneum morphology (report Wilk's lambda of LDA, probability, and refer to figures 6 and 7).  As currently written, it somewhat jarringly jumps to describing individual groups.5. Page 24, lines 634, 636: These lines use the term \"runner\", while \"cursorial\" is used more throughout the manuscript text, and in other literature sources.6. Pages 30 and 32, lines 808 and 899: The headings for these locomotor groups should not be in bold, like the others.7. Page 36, line 1018: It should be noted how the coypu is distinct from the beaver and capybara.  Part of the reason Myocastor does not group with the other semi-aquatic taxa in Figures 6 and 7 may be due its smaller body size.  The functional demands of swimming (i.e. overcoming drag) become more pronounced at larger size, requiring greater specialization.  As Hydrochoerus and Castor are the largest extant rodents, their calcaneo-astragalar specialization for swimming should not be surprising.8.

While the list of measures was comprehensive and appeared appropriate for the goals of the study, very little information was provided on how these assessments were administered. There were quite a few and, given that these were done with relatively young children, it would be important to understand how assessment sessions were structured/scaffold to support the collection of high quality data.Given the large number of variables, it would also be helpful to have a brief section describing the approach to data analysis and rationale for why these approaches were selected prior to reporting Results.                 The authors used a very liberal criterion for statistical significance by employing one-tailed tests (which was supported by a sound rationale) and applying a critical p-value of .10, which was more questionable. Given the results were sig at the .01 level, it is unclear why such a liberal criteria was needed.The use of non-parametric tests was appropriate.Comparisons of the 4 groups on reading measures might have been non-significant due to low power, given that groups sizes were in the range of 13-14 children and no larger than 25. Reporting of effect sizes might be useful here to provide additional evidence for consideration on these comparisons.Given that the one-tailed tests were selected, the brief discussion of the higher scores for the reading group should be removed.The findings from the current study are not fully explained/interpreted in relation to findings from previous (related) studies. For example, very little is offered in terms of why there appear to be inconsistent results across studies examining the association between reading skill and various types of self-concept. The authors should be careful using language regarding causal links and moderation, such as was used on line 470 of the discussion. These are all testable/empirical questions, some of which could be examined using the data that were collected. If the authors believe some sort of moderation or mediation is present, they should test these hypotheses explicitly.There is a mention of &#8220;solid power&#8221;, yet no power analysis was ever reported. A sample of 77 seems generally adequate for the analyses used (t-tests and correlations); however, limitations to power with a sample of this size might have impacted the results when the data were split into four groups.

Training manipulations included low variability (one talker), high variability (four talkers, interleaved presentation), and high variability blocked (four talkers, blocked presentation). Aptitude was assessed with a pitch contour perception task and a categorization task of a synthesized tonal continuum. Tone learning was assessed with discrimination, word identification, and production (word repetition and picture naming) tasks. Although all groups improved on the training and testing tasks from pre-post, no advantage was found for the high-variability groups for trained or untrained stimuli, and no interaction was found with aptitude.The high quality of statistical methods and data analysis was the main strength of the paper: I thank the authors for their careful description of the methods, providing raw data and R scripts, and for using rigorous statistical methods (e.g., mixed effects logistic regression) to analyze their data. However, several major issues with the framing of the study attenuated my enthusiasm for the manuscript, and these are detailed below.A primary concern of this study is that it lacks a strong theoretical motivation, and I was unconvinced that it was necessary to replicate the Perrachione et al. (2011) findings using real Mandarin words. There may be good reasons to investigate whether high-variability training is beneficial for learning in a more ecologically valid situation, but this needs to be discussed and motivated more strongly. The manuscript could be strengthened by discussing a theory or model that would predict different outcomes of the high-variability training paradigm when using real Mandarin words as opposed to pseudowords. Perhaps there is reason to believe that learning Mandarin segmental phonology and tonal contrasts simultaneously would yield different results than previous studies (e.g., Perrachione et al., 2011). Otherwise, it does not seem that this study adds to the field&#8217;s understanding of high-variability training in phonetic learning. The literature review was thorough; however, the introduction could be substantially shortened and streamlined. Instead of giving such detailed descriptions of previous studies, I would recommend discussing the previous literature in the context of a theoretical model of (phonetic) learning and making the core questions of the study more prominent.Line 92: Please cite Bradlow et al. (1999) for long-term retention of production improvements.                 As discussed above, it is not clear that there is a gap in the literature that necessitates this study, and reframing the introduction could help clarify the motivation for using real Mandarin words in training and why this might impact our understanding of high-variability training or phonetic learning more generally.Statistical analyses are appropriate for the data collected, and the methods and analyses are explained in enough detail to enable replication. Plots are easy to read and effectively display the data.In Figure 11 (training data), in the high aptitude group, the HVB and the LV groups look almost indistinguishable from each other, especially for the first few days. However, in the low aptitude group, the LV group looks like they are performing better than the HVB group. Although I agree that using a continuous measure for aptitude gives you more power in the analysis, it might be worth looking at the aptitude variable categorically after all, especially to compare the HVB-trained participants in high- and low-aptitude groups in the training task.                 The discussion section should address in greater detail why the current study did not replicate previous high-variability training studies. I agree that some of the earlier studies were likely underpowered; however, this effect has been replicated several times since then with larger sample sizes (e.g., Lively et al., 1994; Perrachione et al., 2011) and for different speech tasks such as accent adaptation (Bradlow &amp; Bent, 2008) and tone learning (Perrachione et al., 2011). The greatest benefits observed in previous studies of high-variability training have typically been for generalization. Perhaps there was no benefit for generalization in the current study due to the pre-training differences in the trained and untrained talkers. Please address.A discussion on why variability may not be universally beneficial could improve the discussion section, as well, seeing as the LV condition outperformed the HV and HVB conditions on some tasks.Although some of the original predictions were not borne out, I think there are still some valuable findings in this dataset. For example, the fact that participants improved from pre- to post-test on the pitch contour perception task may have methodological relevance, as this task is often used as an aptitude measure (i.e., Is it really measuring aptitude or is it measuring some type of experience?). A more general discussion of this transfer of learning (from training task to PCPT) would also strengthen the discussion.The discussion could be further improved by suggesting specific studies that would need to be done to disentangle some of the inconclusive results of the study.

", "Overall, the manuscript was fairly clear. There were some ambiguities (some of which were listed below) to be clarified.Figures and Tables were appropriate and useful.  For ease of processing, it would be great if the tests were itemized in the same order in Session 1 and 8, and that the authors could indicate that Picture Identification and Picture Naming were additional tests.Table 2 was useful to provide the readers with an overview of the talker manipulation. Given the number of tests administered in the current study, it was difficult for the readers to keep track the purpose of various tests and its relevance to the research questions and predictions, especially when some of them were administered both pre and post-tests; whereas others were only administered post-test.  Perhaps the authors would consider including such information in Table 2.The current ms organized the results (also the procedures) around each administered test.  This made it difficult to relate the results to the research questions and predictions.  It would be great if the authors could re-organize the stimuli, procedures and results according to the purpose of these tests. For instance, measures of aptitude assessment (PCPT, CSTC); measures of learning (word repetition, 3-level-oddity, picture naming, picture identification). Within the measure of learning, the 4 tests can be further sud-divided.                 Line 249-263: the current study tested the benefit of learning from multiple voices, using new paradigm and real Chinese words. It was a partial replication of previous studies on the beneficial effect of learning from multiple voices, as well as the interaction between individual aptitude and learning from multiple voices. Apart from replication, the question was not very well-defined. The ms discussed the 2 studies (Perrachione et al., 2011; Sadakata &amp; McQueen, 2014) and used their findings to motivate the research questions in the current study.  Yet the current study did not point out that Perrachione et al. only manipulated familiar vs novel speakers. That is, the same 18 test items were used in pre-test, training and post-test. Training effect (single talker vs multiple talkers) was generalized to test items from novel speakers. On the other hand, Sakadata &amp; McQueen (2014) manipulated the critical (test) tones along a few dimensions so that the bi-syllabic tone sequences in training was different from those at test.  These dimensions included a new position of the critical tone in the bi-syllabic sequence, a new contextual tone in combination with a critical tone to form a bi-syllabic tone sequence, a new vowel bearing the critical tone, the critical bi-syllabic tone sequence from a novel speaker and the critical tone sequence in a sentence context. These differences raised questions as to what kind of information is being learned during variability training and how these information can be generalized across different types (i.e. speaker-variability, item-variability).  It would have been useful if the experimental design was clearly tabulated: what was varied, what was kept constant during pre-training, training and post-training, for example:Aptitude AssessmentPCPT (pre &amp; post-test)CSTC (pre &amp; post-test)Assessment (in the following 2 tests there was a factor of &#8216;item-novelty&#8217;)Word Repetition (pre &amp; post-test)Three-interval-oddity  (pre &amp; post-test)Picture identification (post-test) &#8211; in familiar voice vs. novel voicePicture naming (post-test)When I grouped the stimuli in Appendix A as below,Training ItemsOnset consonantsT1-T2: Ch, m, q, T1-T3: j, sh, x, T1-T4: b, h, zh, T2-T3: b, w, n, T2-T4: d, x, y, T3-T4: d, m, yVowelsT1-T2: Ua, ao, ia, T1-T3: iao, u, ue, T1-T4: a, ua, u, T2-T3: i, a, iu, T2-T4: i, ie, u, T3-T4: a, i, aNon-training itemsOnset consonantsT1-T2: sh, t, t, T1-T3: m, g, zh, T1-T4: d, k, x, T2-T3: ch, h, y, T2-T4: m, sh, w, T3-T4: b, d, jVowelsT1-T2: i, uo, i, T1-T3: a, ui, e, T1-T4: en, u, ian, T2-T3: i, u, u, T2-T4: o, e, a, T3-T4: ao, ao, ianIt is clear that there was segmental variability for each tone pair contrast and that there was segmental variability between training and non-training items.  So, what was it that one expected learners to generalize to? And what was it that high variability training would benefit learners in this regard?                 The overall result of the current study was that high variability training did not benefit learning Chinese tones and the variability training did not interact with aptitude assessment.  Given my concerns about what kind of generalization and benefit that high variability training would bring to various tasks/tests, I was not convinced about the interpretation of the findings in view of the previous literature (e.g. Lively et al., 1993; Logan et al., 1991 etc).

I have listed many of them in my line-by-line comments, but the authors need to put more care in proofreading the document. In general, the paper could do with some streamlining for clarity. It comes across like a dissertation, and this impression is further enhanced when the reader encounters figure labelling in text that seems to match a dissertation rather than this journal manuscript. The authors could cut the manuscript down by a couple of thousand words by looking carefully at the flow of information and critically assessing the relevance of all points. For example, Sadakata and McQueen is reviewed first at line 109, then again on line 192 (as if it is being introduced for the first time). Do the authors have permission to include the pictures in Appendix A? On line 346 the authors state that they are from \"free online clipart databases\", but do the licenses of these sites allow for republication?Raw data are supplied, but the RMarkdown cannot be executed because the following files have not been supplied: CSTC-curve.csv, Word Repetition.csv, Picture Naming.csv.The data presented in Discrimination.csv are a little confusing because they do not appear to preserve the original order of the stimuli. They are listed as Same1, Same2, and Diff, but there is no record of which position each stimulus was presented in.                 The research is relevant, although the authors have not convincingly explained why they made the methodological choices they did. That is, they described the differences between their study and those of Perrachione et al. and Sadakata and McQueen, but they did not justify those choices (line 249). Why is it beneficial to use real Mandarin words instead of pseudowords? What differences do the authors predict in their results due to their inclusion of the fourth tone? Why did the authors choose a word learning task, and how might this affect the predictions, relative to previous studies?The investigation appears to have been performed to a high technical standard. The methods are certainly described in detail. This could be streamlined somewhat.                 In a number of the figures, the violin plots suggest that there is at least one participant scoring zero on one or more of the conditions (e.g., Figure 4, Figure 5). Looking at the raw data (in Production_all.csv), there appears to something odd going on with Subject 48. Much of the data for Subject 48 has been coded as 0. Are these missing data? It seems that these 0 values have been included in the analysis, which may explain the apparent outliers in Figure 4. There appear to be other cases in that data file where there are zero values (e.g., over 360 lines of data have \"Tone\" coded as 0). If these zero values have been included in the analysis, then all of the results could be incorrect. The authors must clarify this as it suggests that the data presented may not be robust.             Comments:I commend the authors for undertaking this interesting study. There is a lot to read, which makes the text a little difficult to digest, but the research is timely. The failure to observe an effect of variability is problematic. To suggest that previous findings may be incorrect, on the basis of a null result, is over-interpreting the data. There is a lot of work involved in providing all of that raw data, and I appreciate the RMarkdown. It would be helpful if the data were provided in a format that makes it easy for the reader to recreate the analyses. As it turns out, the results include some aspects that need further clarification, in particular the apparently floor performance of at least one participant in a couple of tasks. My own inspection of the raw data raises the question of whether this apparently floor performance may be due to the inclusion of missing data in the analysis. I was unable to check this in R because the RMarkdown required data files that were not provided. I hope that the authors are able to clarify that aspect. If the data presented are a true reflection of performance, then the authors will need to explain the apparently poor performance of that participant in Figures 3 and 4.While reading the document I made line-by-line comments. I hope that these assist the authors in further revisions of the manuscript.Line-by-line comments:Abstract, lines 29-30. \"different variability training\" is vague.

Through observing the expression pattern of Sfrp-4 and functional assay, they found that Sfrp-4 can inhibit but not block the regeneration cycle. Although the topic is important, there are several issues that the authors should take care and address to confirm their hypothesis. 1. Previous study had demonstrated that Sfrp-4 was expressed during the refractory telogen period (Chen et al., 2014). However, in this study, the author only showed the expression pattern during the anagen period. To evaluate the expression pattern of Sfrp-4 during the whole hair regeneration cycle period, including anagen and telogen is recommended. 2. If the Sfrp-4 did inhibit the hair regeneration, why is it expressed strongly in ORS and IRS during anagen period? According to this, the expression of Sfrp-4 should express strongly in telegen period which inhibit the hair stem cell entering anagen period. 3. In figure 3, the author measure the length of regenerated hair follicles to prove that Sfrp-4 did inhibit the regeneration of hair follicle. Can the author explain when they measure the length? Day 4 or the end of the anagen? To measure the full anagen hair follicle length is recommended to determine if Sfrp-4 diminish the period of anangen which let the hair follicle length become shorter.

It would have also been much more informative if the zooxanthellae clade of the genets had been reported as zooxanthellae clade has been shown to affect bleaching and disease susceptibility.  Without that information conclusions drawn are  limited.                 Conclusions drawn and the hypothesis of immune-suppression by zooxanthellae are not supported by the data or other works.  They don't address any other factors that might produce differential bleaching and disease susceptibility with a major failure being not linking zooxanthellae clade to the findings.  They also do not report their findings in a way that allows the study to be evaluated properly.  What size were all of these ramets?  all similar sizes?  clarify.  They also need to report genets/ramets relationships.   Were the ramets that bleached always from the same genet?  Or did that vary among the different time periods?  Ditto for the ramets displaying disease. There is also a current problem in many of the Florida nurseries with fireworm predation common and commonly mistaken for disease.   They may have evidence (clear linear progression?  nocturnal search for fireworms? etc) that it was disease not predation but that was not presented.   Although it is great that they followed individual ramets through time, the study as presented does not support their conclusions.             Comments:Looking at individual ramets through time with temperature is a good idea but the authors jumped to too many conclusions based on many false assumptions.  They also use incorrect nomenclature for disease studies.  I have added suggestion to the text to help improve any future submissions.

Often, when managers or researchers employ grid designs, their primary objective is to estimate density of animals, which requires an estimate of abundance.  I think it would be worthwhile for the authors to discuss the limitations of the targeted design when density estimation is the primary objective. For example, when bears are concentrated near the salmon streams, the density in those areas is inflated for the period of time that salmon are available, then the bears disperse.  Given that many studies will not have radio collared animals, the maximum attraction distance from the concentrated resource are largely going to be unknown.  So this method would probably not work for studies that have the goal of estimating density rather than just simply abundance.Lines 228-230.  I would disagree with the contention that shortening the sampling session automatically confers a time or cost benefit.  I think this would only be for smaller study areas where researchers could reasonably be expected to check all the traps within the shortened session without having to hire extra personnel to do so. For large study areas with a given number of traps or grid cells, having longer sessions, thus allowing the limited number of field personnel that can be hired on a fixed budget to check all traps within each session, redeploy them, then start over.  For large projects, with lots of traps a shorter capture session would necessitate that you have more personnel available to check all the traps within each sampling session.Minor commentsLine 39.

Boll weevils are not attached or encased in cotton leaves; therefore, defoliating cotton leaves per se will not be effective management.  In the cited manuscript, beetles were affected through direct contact spraying and in some combinations there was a synergistic effect between defoliant(s) and insecticide(s).  In your methods, to be parallel to the Greenberger publication, you should have tested the direct effect of the defoliate on the mites.  In contrast, Bemisia tabaci nymphs are attached to the leaves, so defoliating the leaves also defoliates the nymphs, which subsequently died due to lack of food.

Although Fisher's exact test was applied to evaluate the statistical significance of the enrichment, I do not follow the validity of this hypothesis testing method. In my opinion, random networks constructed based on the original gene networks should be better random controls. Even statistically significant clusters enriched with pathogenic genes or CNVs were found, the biomedical meanings of these clusters are still unclear.

The authors implemented a Markov clustering method to group the documented protein-protein interaction into small protein sets. Some biases might exist in this process. The PPI network has no specific information for the conditions or phenotypes, which just collected the binary links between proteins, i.e., the interaction does not contain a metric to measure their associations with the conditions such as health disparties. The MCL methods can also be used to group weighted graphs. The gene network should be conditioned before the prediction. The authors should clarify this issue. Moreover, the interactions in the two databases contain many noise, the network should be justified firstly.2. The comparison study with GWAS study.

Principal concerns relate to extrapolations based upon unsound physiological reasoning and inappropriate terminology (e.g. &#8220;anaerobic threshold&#8221;) and errors regarding energetics.  These are perceived as readily addressable in revision.SPECIFIC COMMENTSLINE(S)Introduction. In human exercise physiology (as well as horse, rodent and other quadrupeds) the concept of &#8220;Critical Power&#8221; or &#8220;Critical Speed&#8221;) is gaining traction to explain their exercise energetics and tolerance (see Poole and Erickson, 2011 (cited) as well as Jones et al. (Med. Sci.Sports Exerc.  42: 1876-90, 2010) and Copp et al. (J. Physiol. (Lond.) 588: 5077-87, 2011). Indeed,The discrimination between sprinters (high W&#8217;, energy storage component, low critical speed) and distance (low W&#8217;, high critical speed) athletes would fit with the puma versus dog comparison herein.Methods. Despite the heroic and very advanced data collection techniques and the perceived high quality data presented the n=2 pumas is a limitation that needs to be stated up front in the Abstract.209\t&#8220;mm:ss&#8221; 167\tThe term &#8220;anaerobic threshold&#8221; is now recognized as mechanistically in error.  Specifically, nowhere has anaerobiosis been identified in skeletal muscle when lactate is being produced during exercise. Suggest the term &#8220;lactate threshold&#8221; or &#8220;gas exchange threshold&#8221; to depict how this metabolic rate was determined, as relevant.170\tHere and throughout. Replace &#8220;comparable&#8221; with &#8220;similar.&#8221;  Anything can be co pared but it does not mean they are similar!257\tThis carry over from the Weibel/Taylor days is simply not correct.  Animals and humans increase their blood lactate concentration typically at 50-60% of their VO2max.  At those metabolic rates there is no obligatory anaerobiosis.  This well know in the human literature and, again, is obvious also from horses (e.g., McDonough et al. JAPPL 92: 1499-1505, 2002), dogs, rodents, and all other species studied &#8211; to my knowledge.266-\tAgain discussion of Critical Speed would be valuable here.295\t&#8220;exhaustion and/or overheating&#8221; Is there evidence collected herein to support this or is it speculation?

It has the basic components in computational genome studies. I have the following suggestions:Since the study is a data integration study. Special care has to be taken for data normalization among those input datasets. The authors should carefully write down most of the parameter setting for readers. Otherwise, readers may not be convinced.From line 118 to 200, the authors have described the off-the-book-shelf concepts in bioinformatics.

Intro and BackgroundLines 19-21 do not seem correct, in line 180 of the paper the author states that the IR can be up to 76kb which if line 20 is true then the SSC and LSC would need to be extremely small. I would suggest reviewing those references.Line 189-190 the Walker, Zanis and Emery Citation is incorrect, that was not a suggestion from the study. It would be more applicable to have the citation after line 188 as it showed that the SSC, LSC and IR differ in rates of molecular evolution, similar to how the authors found difference in Ks values for the SSC, LSC and IR.Line 192 miss cites Walker et. al 2015. In Walker et. al 2015 they argue against the SSC being a hotspot for inversion events on an evolutionary scale, as the SSC is found in both directions in the plant cells. For further information on this a good resource is: Palmer, 1983 \"Chloroplast DNA exists in two orientations\"Line 196 it is difficult to tell what the authors mean by gene loss is an on going process, are they talking about in chloroplasts? There should be a citation after this or a more thorough explanation.Line 225 to 227 there should be some form of correction for multiple comparisons such as a bonferroni correction, finding a Ka/Ks ratio above 1 could easily be a by product of having performed the test on so many samples.Line 244 should specify what is meant by rapid evolution. Is this a rapid molecular rate or some form of radiation.FiguresFor Figure 1. It&#8217;s bothering me that so many of the chloroplast genes are missing. Your IR regions should be exactly the same just reverse complement, yet IRA is missing the YCF2 gene and IRB is missing ndhB and rps7. I would strongly recommend going through and making sure this is all annotated correctly.For Figure 2. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why you are showing the Ks values here, it may help the figure if you separated the genes into the IR, SSC and LSC regions and showed the difference in Ks values for those. You would likely see a dip in the Ks values for those from the IR. Also, if you are doing a multiple comparison such as this it would be good to include some sort of correction for multiple comparisons, such as a bonferroni correction, since when you do this many comparisons by chance alone you would expect some of these to have a Ka/Ks value above 1.Figure 3. This tree looks to be unrooted, you have your outgroup forming a polytomy with multiple clades, the tree should be properly rooted on the outgroup before you make any inference regarding the relationships.                 Overall as the experimental design is written out now, I would not be able to replicate the study. It would be very useful for the authors to give a more thorough explanation of the programs they used.There are a few times that programs are mentioned in the results but are not put in the methods, such as mVISTA is mentioned on line 131 but not mentioned anywhere else.On line 134 ndhE is said to have a high amount of divergence but it is said to be missing as part of GapC on line 124.For the Genome annotation: I don&#8217;t think you can verify start and stop codons using BLAST, BLAST is typically left to be just a homology search tool. Do the authors mean that they searched Genbank and compared their start and stop codons to closely related species?For the Comparative analysis: I am not sure how the authors were able to analyze nucleotide and amino acid diversity from BLAST. If they could elaborate on that, it would be very helpful. Also, I believe Geneious is a set of programs, if the authors could elaborate on what setting or which programs in Geneious they used to identify differences that would be very helpful.For the Phylogenetic analysis: It seems like in creating the phylogeny the authors concatenated all the genes together and built the phylogeny out of that. However, we know that the different regions have different rates of evolution and therefore it would be highly valuable for the authors to re-run the phylogenetic analysis with the data partitioned by gene. This will allow a separate model of evolution to be inferred for each gene and help lower some of the bias created by using genes that evolve at different rates. The authors also state they use the GTR model of evolution, which should be great, but they should also account for invariability of sites using either INV or Gamma, both options should be available in PhyML.In continuing with the phylogenetic analysis although the authors used an outgroup, based on Figure 3 they appear to have never rooted the tree.                 A lot of the analyses appear to need to be re-examined, such as the un-rooted phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3), the missing genes in the chloroplast IR (Fig 1.) and the use of BLAST as a means of assessing nucleotide and amino acid diversity, instead of leaving it as a tool for homology identification.Regarding the conclusions, the authors appear to have a very interesting story regarding gene loss in the chloroplast; however, this is not emphasized in the conclusion. While the paper has some extensive discussion regarding gene loss, the conclusion fails to mention this.             Comments:You have a very interesting story regarding gene loss in the chloroplast and appear to have created a valuable genomic resource, however, there appears to be a number of issues with the analyses that you ran. I would strongly suggest re-running many of the analyses and doing a more thorough check on the ndh gene loss. Best of luck with your study!                                                ", "My main concern is that the study does not appear to be a logical unit for publication. High-throughput sequencing and increasing computational sophistication in the bioinformatics community have made the assembly of complete chloroplast genomes a highly automated process. That is not to say a single chloroplast genome cannot be worthy of a full analysis, but I do not feel a strong case was made for such an exception here. Several of the results in this analysis identify the chloroplast genome of Gentiana lawrencei var. farreri as possessing a structure consistent with that of most land plants. These observations are unnecessary and dilute the more substantial results of the study. The article could potentially be improved by providing more background on particular features of the cp genome as they relate to Gentiana and then focusing on these features in the analyses rather than listing characteristics of the genome that are not obviously connected to any particular research question. Given the content currently included in the article, it would more appropriately be presented as a brief 2-page note.                 Substantial improvements could be made in outlining the research question(s) addressed by sequencing the chloroplast genome of Gentiana lawrencei var. farreri. Many potentially interesting and meaningful features of the genome are identified in the article, but the conceptual framework underlying them is frequently missing. It is also unclear why certain analyses were conducted while others were not. Why was G. crassicaulis not included in comparative analyses? The comparative section of the study has the potential to be expanded into an appropriate publication unit, especially if other species in Gentianaceae were included. The purpose of the phylogenetic analysis is also unclear. As far as I can tell, the only novel finding from the tree is that G. crassicaulis and G. straminea are more closely related to one another than either is to G. lawrencei var. farreri, but this result is not highlighted by the authors and was presumably identified in previous phylogenies.                 The results as presented appear to me to be sound, although some additional details on methods would be helpful. The main issue with conclusions are that they are sometimes vague, suggesting the chloroplast genome presented here will help conservation efforts in the genus Gentiana. Such a conclusion may be true, but it is not at all obvious why the chloroplast genome would be particularly useful for that purpose. Again, there is a disconnect between reported results and the focus of the study, so the article lacks logical cohesion. Limiting the features of the chloroplast genome that are highlighted and supporting them with an expanded biological context would make the study a potentially valuable contribution beyond the production of a single plastome.             Comments:I did not see anything wrong with the data you generated, and I found some of the comparative analyses interesting. However, given the relative ease with which chloroplast genomes can be sequenced, assembled, and annotated, publication of a single genome needs to be supported by a strong conceptual framework and guided by a clear set of research questions. I think it is possible to do this with your study by including the other species of Gentiana (and possibly other Gentianaceae) in your comparative analyses and focusing the introduction and discussion on a subset of features.                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.7312": ["The manuscript requires some further editing to correct grammar throughout.                 The introduction provides a general review of plant Hsfs and Hsps, but it is not clear how this material sets up the rationale for this study, or the gaps in knowledge that this study fills.  The data provided in this study are clearly unique, but I think the authors could do a better job of explaining how their work connects to and expands on what is known about plant Hsfs and Hsps.  The authors could also be clearer on why this study focuses on the small Hsps specifically.  How is it beneficial to add information on these genes for P. mume?Phylogenetic analysis: I suggest describing the settings used in Mega to produce the phylogenies.  If the default settings were used that should be stated.qRT-PCR design: There are a number of details that I think are important to include in the methods section.  It would be helpful if the authors stated whether primers were designed to produce products spanning introns to reduce the chance that genomic DNA was amplified (for genes that contain introns).  Were products from each primer pair sequenced to determine if the correct gene was amplified?  Was melt curve analysis used to ensure a single product was generated?  Were negative RT and water negative controls used?  Has EF1a been validated as a good reference gene for P. mume or at least other plant qRT-PCR experiments?  If not, why was this gene chosen?  What range in Cq value was accepted within a single technical triplicate (0.5 or other value)?  The use of two reference genes would improve the strength of these data, and could be considered for any future experiments.  I would suggest some other revisions to the description of the qRT-PCR design as recommended by the MIQE guidelines.  These suggest referring to control genes as &#8220;reference genes&#8221; and the use of Cq instead of Ct. Were efficiencies calculated for each primer pair?                 The data in the paper are well presented and described.  Figures are effective.  Conclusions resulting from the figures are valid.  The descriptions of upregulation and downregulation in the qRT-PCR data seem valid as the changes in expression are so large for many of the genes.  It is a bit confusing that each y-axis differs depending on the amount of gene expression change, which visually makes it difficult to compare the extent of expression change from gene to gene.  Perhaps the authors can clearly note that y-axis scales differ to allow presentation of all data in one figure.  It might also be helpful to clearly state the fold difference that was considered significant.  Is it appropriate to use an ANOVA to show statistical significance for these changes?Most of the first paragraph of the discussion reiterates information from the introduction.  I would recommend using this first paragraph to stress the contributions of this current study.  Line 251 beginning paragraph 2 could more clearly state that it is similarities between P. mume and Arabidopsis that was conserved.Paragraph 3 starting on line 258 seems to restate some of the findings, but could better explain the importance of these findings.Paragraph 4 restates a result.  Is this loss of the beta 6 sheet found in any other plants or eukaryotes?  Or is this a unique finding in P. mume?Paragraph 5 starting on line 270 restates information from the introduction on cellular localization.  Since no cellular localization data are provided for expression of the P. mume genes I am not sure if this information is relevant in the discussion.The discussion on timing of gene expression during heat stress also restates the results.  How do these results compare to what is known about timing of heat shock response in other eukaryotes? What do these data add to our understanding of heat shock response in plants?  Why might these different temporal patterns exist?             Comments:The authors present a novel data set that will be of interest to researchers working on plant heat stress response.

Comments:General comments----------------This manuscript argues that unimodal species response curves can be estimated using models that contain a random site effect, instead of the more direct approach of including quadratic terms into the model.  A simple diagnostic for detecting unimodality is also presented and tested using simulations.An honest comparison of the authors' random site effect approach with the explicit quadratic term approach is given.  I appreciate this honest discussion.  As the authors point out, the random site effect approach requires the assumption of equal tolerances among species (lines 235-6) and that their assumption of independence and normality of the random site effects will also typically be broken in data sets with unmodality (lines 236-8).  However, they show that their method is robust to these violated assumptions in a variety of ways and point out that their method has computational advantages that could be very useful in applied problems (particularly in latent variable modelling).Overall this manuscript provides a useful alternative approach to modelling unimodal species response curves and provides a balanced discussion of its potential.

Would zero residuals indicate estimated tolerances that are exactly homogeneous among species?(B) I'm wondering about the statistical theory here.  Isn't there a circularity problem with the t-test assumptions given that the response, \\gamma, is estimated from a model that includes the predictors, x and S?

But Xu et al. 2017 concluded \" The molecular markers linked to Sr2, Sr24, Sr26, Sr31, and Sr38 were used to detect the occurrence of these genes in 75 major wheat cultivars (lines) in Gansu Province in this study. The results showed that 35 tested cultivars might carry one of these genes.\" where as in this study it is concluded as \"Overall, genes Sr31, and Sr38 were differently distributed across wheat regions in China and none of the wheat cultivars contained Sr24 and Sr26.\" For me it looks a bit contradicting concerning Sr24 and Sr26.

No idea about the Aims and Scope of the journal, but it was clear that the authors tried to replicate their previous result as closely as possible, which is admirable.                 As is written on line 128, an unaware reader might misinterpret the replication hypothesis, where it is stated that H_{r} is the original correlation. It&#8217;s true that Josine&#8217;s R-code uses the original observed correlation r_{ori} and n_{ori}, but it does not mean that the alternative hypothesis is specified as the point r_{ori}. Instead, a whole range of population correlation rho&#8217;s is specified as the alternative hypothesis, see Figure 2 (in fact, the code provided in this review). This aforementioned whole range is the posterior on rho informed by the data of the original study. It is correct that this posterior is peaked at r_{ori} and its concentration depends on n_{ori}; the larger n_{ori} the more peaked it is. As n_{ori} is not extremely large it is definitely not a point hypothesis. In other words, the replication Bayes factor uses the posterior based on data of the original study as a prior for the replication attempt. Moreover, in Ly, Etz, Marsman, &amp; Wagenmakers (2017), see \thttps://psyarxiv.com/u8m2s/it is clarified that the replication Bayes factor quantifies the evidence within the data of the replication attempt given the data of the original study.

Currently, many sentences do not make sense and the meaning is often ambiguous.- The introduction does not clearly lay out the aim of the study. The authors suggest that not much work on cetacean microbiomes has been undertaken, but there is a moderate amount of literature surrounding cetacean microbiomes (e.g. see Apprill et al 2014, Humpback whales share a core skin bacterial community: towards a health index for marine mammals?; Bierlich et al, 2018, Temporal and regional variability in the skin microbiome of humpback whales along the Western Antarctic peninsula; Sanders et al, 2015, Baleen whales host a unique gut microbiome with similarities to both carnivores and herbovires, etc) , albeit not of stranded individuals (although see Godoy-Vitorino et al, 2017, The microbiome of a striped dolphin stranded in Portugal) . The authors go on to suggest that stranding is a large issue in cetacean biology (I suppose specifically in conservation, although this isn&#8217;t mentioned and perhaps should be), and that this research will shed light on the microbiome related to host physiological characteristics, deep-sea adaptation and stranding. This creates an unclear perspective of what this paper is about, particularly because neither physiological characteristics nor deep-sea adaptations are further discussed. I would suggest re-writing the introduction with a focus on what is currently known about the cetacean microbiome (citing papers which have explored this already), and that this study addresses the gap in knowledge we have about the microbiome of stranded cetaceans.- The discussion is too short and does not actually discuss the findings of the paper in depth. The authors should focus more on what their results actually show (at a fine-scale) and how this links with the broader literature of cetacean microbiomes (and microbiome work in general).- I could not find the raw data. The NCBI accession number shared by the authors took me to the sperm whale genome, but not to the data generated in this study (that I could see)- Figures and tables:Figure 1A: A PCA of species with sample type overlaid would be a clearer and more informative way to visualise this data. If a Venn diagram must be used, it would be helpful to at least have the circle sizes proportional to the number of species found.Figure 1B: clarification needed. Is this the top 20 most abundance species across all tissue types?Figure 2A: the proportions of firmicutes and euaryarchaeota don&#8217;t seem to match the proportions reported in line 158 of the textTable 4 is not mentioned in the textFigure 3C is missingFigure 3B: it would be good to have species names here (could still be coloured by clade e.g. dolphin/whale).                 - This is an opportunistic study which took advantage of a rare event occurring - the stranding of a sperm whale with the opportunity to sample it - and the results, although interesting and providing new knowledge to the field of microbiome research, must be seen within this context. In particular, it must be acknowledged that there is a sample size of 1 in this study, and therefore the scope of what it can tell us about the sperm whale microbiome is extremely limited. - The research question is not well-defined by the authors. As previously mentioned, the introduction needs to be rewritten in order to put this study in context, and it must also clearly define the research question. Arguably, the aim of the study is to characterise the blood, muscle and fecal microbiome of a stranded sperm whale, compare the results with published cetacean microbiomes to understand whether the microbiome of a stranded sample still shows similarity to other cetacean samples, and explore *possible* pathogenic bacterial species and parasitic species present in the whale. - Comments on the methods:My largest concern in the methods is the lack of control for, or discussion of, contamination. Contamination is a common problem in microbiome studies (e.g. see Salter SJ, Cox MJ, Turek EM, Calus ST, Cookson WO, Moffatt MF, et al. Reagent and laboratory contamination can critically impact sequence-based microbiome analyses. BMC Biol. 2014;12:87.), and can be at least partially controlled with the inclusion of blanks at the sequencing stage. There is no discussion of blanks in this paper, and I therefore assume that they were not included.  As a late-stage method to understand whether contamination from human skin may influence results, the authors could align the unfiltered data to the human genome to understand whether human contamination (and therefore human-associated microbiome contamination) has occurred (for an example of this and further ways to address possible contamination see Hooper R, Brealey JC, van der Valk T et al. (2018) Host-derived population genomics data provides insights into bacterial and diatom composition of the killer whale skin. Molecular Ecology). Given that some of the bacterial species identified in the study are common to human skin (e.g. Streptococcus species, which is also a common lab contaminant) I think this is a step which must be taken in order to understand whether we need to interpret the results with the caveat of contamination.The authors must address the concern of contamination at each stage - what steps were taken to identify/remove contamination at the sampling stage (for which methodological detail must be expanded - how were samples collected? how was human contamination avoided?), at the sequencing stage (were blanks included?), and finally at the bioinformatics stage (were any bioinformatics techniques used to try to identify whether contamination had occurred?) to mitigate this potential confound.Other concerns about the methods section are listed below:&#8226;\tTryptophan pathway: To leap from missing KOs to the whale being susceptible to colitis and CNS inflammation is extremely speculative, primarily because these KOs may be missing only post-stranding/post-death due to changes in community composition. I do not think that this analysis should be kept in the manuscript. &#8226;\tUnsure what Figs 3a and 3b, and associated analysis, add to the manuscript. How do they fit with the study? What, of interest, are they showing us? The trees seem quite uninformative and the analysis doesn&#8217;t have any context in this study. &#8226;\tMore information is needed on the building of the cluster tree. What data did the authors use? Did they download the data from each of these species (and if so, where from?). Are they all gut microbiomes? How does this fit with the rest of the study? This is not discussed at all later &#8211; it is a very interesting result but is barely touched upon and not integrated into the manuscript. The authors should also explain why they use 16S data for this analysis, as opposed to shotgun data used in the rest of the paper (I assume so that a direct comparison between datasets can be made)&#8226;\tIs gut synonymous with fecal in the methods? Confusing terminology; should be clarified.&#8226;\tMore details on sample collection needed. How were the samples collected? &#8226;\tLine 122: do you mean adapters were removed?

The muscle and gut samples were both taken post-death of a stranded whale. After death, the microbiome is likely to change due to chemical changes in the body. For example, species of bacteria which respire anaerobically are likely to dominate (such as clostridium spp.). Thus, the microbiome seen in the recently deceased sperm whale could reflect post- mortem changes in the microbiome, as opposed to, as the author&#8217;s suggest, the microbiome of a sperm whale which is unwell and likely to strand. The blood sample was taken post-stranding, but while the whale was still alive. This is likely to show the microbiome of an individual that is stressed and, possibly, dying, but it is purely speculative to suggest that the blood microbiome of a post-stranded individual shows what the microbiome of a pre-stranded individual may look like. It is unlikely that the microbiome (blood, muscle or gut) of pre-stranding whales is likely to be similar to those of post-stranding whales given that internal conditions of the whale post-stranding are likely to differ dramatically to that of pre-stranding, and therefore different bacterial species are likely to dominate.In brief, the authors assert that the pathogenic bacterial species (and associated virulence genes) found in this whale&#8217;s microbiome are likely to have caused its stranding. This is flawed reasoning because i) the microbiome of the stranded whale is likely to have changed post-stranding, and thus this research only sheds light on what the microbiome of a stranded sperm whale looks like, and ii) see issue 2. The manuscript therefore needs to be rephrased to take this into account. This will require a re-framing of both the introduction and the discussion. Issue 2) pathogenic bacteriaThe authors suggest that they have identified pathogenic bacterial species and parasites, which likely played some role in the death of the individual. However, many bacterial species which have been found to have pathogenic properties are actually also often found as commensal species. For example, Fusobacterium nucleatum is a commensal of the human oral microbiome, but can play a role in disease. The same is true of many Streptococcus species (which also are often found as part of the human microbiome). Whereas parasites are pathogenic, and the high quantity of them in this individual probably suggests ill health (although whether they were the cause of stranding/death is unknown as there is no healthy control whale to compare with), the bacterial species that are identified could very well be commensal species. I therefore think that the identification of possible pathogenic bacterial species should be included only in the discussion and should be highlighted as quite speculative, with a need for further study (with a healthy control for comparison).The finding of a high abundance of parasites is interesting, but without a healthy control, it cannot be known whether this is an unusually high abundance of parasites. The authors have again made some very strong assertions that these parasites played a role in the death of the whale, but this is unfounded. At best, the authors can say that the high abundance of parasites may be related to poor pre-stranding health of the individual, however comparisons with other individuals would be needed to understand whether such high parasite loads are atypical and related in any way to the frequency of strandings.

More discussion on the stranding of whales and the microbiome of mammals would provide a better background.                 As this stranded whale was very near to death and the pathogens in the body were a cause it would be interested to discuss further the pathogens and the symptoms observed.

Taken on its own, I would say the article is publishable but my major concern with the acceptance of this paper in its current state is the similarity to their previous publication, Faulkes et al 2010 Cladogenesis and endemism in Tanzanian mole-rats, genus Fukomys: (Rodentia: Bathyergidae): a role for tectonics? Some of the text appears to be taken directly from their previous article (quick comparisons of abstract reveal major similarities), updating the text and analyses with the additional samples.  I caution the authors on this pattern and recommend that authors revise the article to focus on what new information adds/changes/supports, removing some of the redundancy with their previous publication.                 The research question of this submission is relevant and meaningful, characterizing and naming novel species and understanding the phylogeographic history of this cryptic group of rodent.  Using the phylogenetic species concept, they support the recognition of two new species. There are areas for improvement in the writing and analyses.  1) Sampling: While it is difficult and costly to get these animals, the numbers are biased between the groupings and limited on how representative they are of a species. The analyses of this small of a data set provide little power, potentially introducing bias. 2) Morphometrics: The analyses seems appropriate, but what is striking to me is how limited the results are by the sample size. Similar publication that have used morphometrics as a means to differentiate species of mammals have at least 3X the number included for F. hanangensis and over 10X what is presented for F. livingstoni.  The choice of additional representatives is questionable.  It would be useful to have the colonies/localities identified for F. hanangenesis samples to reveal how points are distributed.  Why did they only include the 3 individuals from Kingogo and not the other whytei samples included previously? While they present that these are from the nearest population, the sample size is not appropriate and I would argue they should use all available data.   This lack of inclusion that had previously revealed no difference is suspect. Why not include additional species of Fukomys that are closely related to explore the mopho space more thoroughly? 2) Molecular data: this is based on a single locus of mtDNA. While cytb has been used in the past, that was of a time when sequencing was difficult this is an area of debate on whether of not this should be the only line of evidence for recognizing new species.  It is a new age of molecular techniques and there are many more markers available, including the 3,999 concatenated genes that they point out have been used for this group.  While it may not change the results, the addition of some nuclear loci would provide additional evidence for their hypothesis.   It is unclear in the text if they were able get the entire cytb fragment for all individuals sequenced and this should be clarified.  If not, missing data should be addressed as this could potentially bias branch lengths and divergence time estimates.   3) Phylogenetic analyses:  Since all methods used here are heuristic searches, it is suggested that multiple runs within analysis type (MP, ML, BA) use replicates of each using different starting points, in the form of random seeds, multiple chains of heated vs cold, to determine that all searches are converging on the same topology/tree space. While this may have been done, it isn't clear in the current draft. Authors should clarify or expand on.   It is also recommended that &gt;100 bootstraps be performed (1000, 10000).                 This study provides confirmation of the placement of F. zechi which had previously lacked any molecular data and the phylogenetic placement of two disjunct populations of Fukomys in Tanzania.  Phylogenetic relationship within this region (extending to Zambia) have been problematic.  While they are able to distinguish these two regions as being distinct lineage with high bootstrap support and posterior probabilities, the relationships to other species of Fukomys and their phylogeographic history is where they lack support (ML BS = 67, 75), not being resolved by this single locus.  While this does provide a working hypothesis, it is limited in how much it add to our understanding of evolution within this group.  Additional lines of evidence should be included (eg. chromosomal, nuclear). As stated in the previous section, I find the validity of their findings are limited by sampling.  As they state themselves, bathyergid rodents are know for having a great deal of intraspecific variation so a much larger sample size should be included to eliminate the bias a small sample can introduce.  Because of this variation, I don't think it is appropriate to only compare skulls of a few individuals.

Diagnoses and descriptions should be slightly improved and expanded considering all the Fukomys species. Some suggestions appear in the pdf file.                 The scientific approach is rigorous and accurate especially regarding phylogenetic and morphometric methods. However, the authors did not explain clearly the interest of using these different methods, which finally lead to the same results (e.g. parsimony vs maximum likelihood for phylogeny, morphometrics vs basic measurements).                 The data are discussed according to the geographical proximity of the species (i.e. in Tanzania), but the phylogenetic proximity is not importantly consider especially regarding morphological and morphometric analyses. It is however necessary to integrate this aspect in the diagnoses and the descriptions, to more accurately consider morphological differences between species, and to define the new species on a fair basis (in addition to molecular evidence). As a result, more comparisons with other Fukomys species are needed in the part dealing with systematics. There are also much more to say about the morphological differences between the new species. Morphometric results also need to be confirmed with statistical tests. Genetic distances between the different haplotypes of the new species should also be shown.

Due to the limited number of biological replicates and only one genotype, it is difficult to judge if the results from this study are representative of a broader population.  Also, due to differences in collection times of control vs. inoculated samples and the use of only 2 biological reps, it is impossible to know what type of variation may be present.  I say this, while also taking into consideration the difficulty of isolating enough RNA using LMD.  However, greater care may have been taken to standardize the sampling process, and the addition of an extra biological rep that was then pooled may have been more representative and allowed for more confidence with the results.

Further development of laser dissection, coupled with microscopy, will enable great advances in our understanding of the manner in which trees respond to pathogens, when both chemical and morphological responses can be linked directly to gene regulation.

They report that all repeat domains are present in almost every organism in all domains of the tree of life, with differences in abundance, and that it is expected to see more TRP containing proteins in virulence factors of pathogen bacteria, but didn&#8217;t.The overall impression I get is that this paper is rather similar to the Ankyrin paper.

However, I would like to see a test, some evidence, or confidence values on how the repeat domains are predicted. I understand the authors rely on the SUPERFAMILY database and therefore on their predictions. However, this is the base of this research and some support on it could reinforce the validity of the analysis.Additionally, would the results change if redundancy is eliminated from the dataset? I'm concerned with the fact that there is too much redundancy in the species they analyze and their proteomes. Specially, because of the percentage thresholds they set.

I think this correlation has no biological meaning and should be taken out of the manuscript, or otherwise specified why does the authors think this correlation is important? It is obvious that the presence of TPR is going to correlate with everything else since this domain is widely distributed across the whole tree of life.I certainly enjoyed the discussion on the Mollicutes, since these organisms tend to fall out of generalities. However, the speculation about how the tandem repeat domain-containing proteins is related to their cell wall seems unsustainable. I believe that speculations this size without any evidence can be harmful to the way science is done. I would strongly advice to remove lines 224-226 unless the idea can be correctly supported.Minor points:The order of the figures is confusing, figure 3 appears before figure 2 in the text and it is distracting.

", "The figures could use some more work to be clearer in what they represent and the figure legends should be more descriptive so that they stand alone from the text. Figure 3 could be enlarged, and perhaps rearranged so that the plots fall along one column instead of two so that the very important and descriptive information it contains is more easily read. Figure 4 needs to be much better clarified in both the legend and graphical representation. Make a header on top after the dendrogram branches to delineate what the different column notations represent: i.e. \"species abbreviations\" (does each three letter abbreviation refer to one species or is it the full 6 letter abbreviation?); \"carbohydrate location\"; \"vegetation type\"; and \"availability density plot\". I don't think a reader should have to dig out the supplementary to understand a main figure, so it would also be nice to have the abbreviations listed along with the figure, or just rework the figure so that you don't need abbreviations and instead write the full species name in normal scientific nomenclature (i.e. B. patula, etc.). I realize this could make the figure too cluttered, but above all else, the authors need to do a better job of making this figure and its information stand alone without a bunch of \"accessory\" tables and legends and back and forth referencing in the text. In fact, the dendrogram is highly irrelevant and could be put in supplementary, while the phase density plots could be emphasized much more. I think this is also data that can and should answer \"at what time of year should foragers target what vegetation types?\" given the availability of different types of USO and aboveground carbohydrates. This leads me to also point out that the Fig. 4 legend needs to be more informative, and the corresponding manuscript text is similarly sparse, making this already complex figure even more enigmatic. Explain where the phenophases are represented on the figure (are they the boxed letters? I have no idea by looking at the figure alone, can you color the nodes or make them stand out more?). Also, you should bracket the density plot (I think? It is not named or referred to anywhere I can find, so I don't know what else to call this) within its correspondent dendrogram branches, or color code the tree branches and density plot together... something to make this more intuitive and easier to read.Figure S2: Again this is an extremely informative graphic but is not well documented or intuitively illustrated, and it provides information that would be relevant for a main figure, or at least descriptive paragraph in the main text where this information is otherwise lacking. Please improve the legend at the very least. What is the difference in the rows? Why is a species named on the top row, and a family named on the bottom? Why do some have 4 rows, but no identifier? The lack of clear reporting here strikes me as somewhat hasty and incoherent. I find Fig. 2 somewhat uninformative for the space it takes and think this is space that could be more effectively used to convey more information, such as the availability of different types of carbohydrates across the year. The authors have cited Marlowe and Berbesque 2009, and I think their figures 2 and 3 could be similarly implemented in this study, and give a much better overview of food availability per region across time.                 In their paper titled, \"Seasonal availability of edible underground and aboveground carbohydrate resources to human foragers...\", the authors aim to assess the year-round availability of plant carbohydrate in 4 different vegetation types near the coast of South Africa. This was accomplished by manually surveying plots of land every six weeks for two years and tallying all edible plants that were visible along a transect. A total of 52 different species were recorded for all territories. The study design and execution is mostly sound, but for one methodological decision that is not adequately addressed, and yet has potentially profound effects on the results as reported by the authors. Specifically, the authors report that species were counted as \"available to foragers\" if their above ground parts were visible, and in the case of above-ground carbohydrates, viable. However, there is no criteria given to explain what constitutes \"visible\" and \"viable\". Instead, the reader must piece this all together through a bunch of disparate information, flipping through an in-press paper, supplementary figures, and sparse raw data descriptions. This is the core element of the methodology and it is essentially glossed over in a quick 2-lines and it is entirely ambiguous as to what \"visible\" actually means, and how it relates to plant viability, particularly for USOs. The results cannot be accepted as reported without these methods explained better. Several questions are immediately raised when I read this and should be answered in the methods:1. What does \"visible\" mean?2. Does \"not visible\" mean all parts of the plant are no longer showing in any way, or does this just refer to greenery, leaves and/or blooms? What about stems or vines, were they visible?3. Is \"visibility\" informed by ethnographic information for how extant foragers recognize and target edible plants? I can't help but think not, because many ethnographies describe foragers as being able to recognize USO-bearing plants through associated foliage such as trees that the vines wrap around and etc.. The in-press paper has also not clarified these methods, and even makes the point that their informants have seemingly lost a lot of indigenous botanical knowledge, making it almost a point of misinformation. Given how critical this element is to the study, I am surprised that the authors have made no attempt to justify, compare, or explain their methods within the context of the greater ethnographic work on sub-Saharan foragers.4. How well trained were the surveyors in identifying signal phenophases of viable plants? Was there any kind of practice or oversight or expert informant?5. How do the author's survey methods of plant availability relate to previous works that attempted similar plant biomass calculations? Are they comparable? Maybe not since this study used binary classification of availability rather than mass or calorie-based calculations, which are more informative from a nutritional availability perspective.Methods about the hierarchical clustering are vague, especially where on lines 201-203 the authors state that \"Defining clusters was not performed using a strict dissimilarity threshold, but rather involved intuitive exploration of the phenograms of different potential clusters while endeavoring to maintain cluster thresholds that were fairly similar\". I understand the data are not even since differences occur in number and overlap of species per site, but if \"intuitive\" data exploration has been conducted, then it needs to be more rigorously explained or demonstrated, otherwise it sounds like some clusters could be rather arbitrarily inclusive or exclusive.                 The validity of the findings requires more attention to methodologies as described above, and further discussion or reporting about how visible \"availability\" relates to actual nutritional availability. As in, do low visible richness periods actually map on to low nutritionally rich periods? Can low visible richness still coincide with high nutritional availability (calorically) if the few \"visible\" species are highly nutritious. Therefore, the landscape could have differential \"evenness\" in the nutritional profile than that conveyed by \"visible\" profile. This is assuming that the visibility criteria used by the authors is a fair depiction of forager ability to identify available and viable species, which I question.             Comments:Italicize scientific nomenclature in text and tablesThere is a lot of scattered methodological information that needs to be consolidated and concisely presented in the main body of the text regarding criteria for selecting \"visible\" plants as \"present\" at a given time in a given site. The authors need to spend a lot more time making this absolutely clear and preferably well supported and justified with citations.Table 2 would be more informative with some indication of the different species&#8217; nutritional value (even qualitative, as I realize the authors state that nutritional analyses have not been done for many above-ground species but many are fruits and seeds that are usually nutrient rich).Given that the plots sampled are upwards of 50km away from each other, it would be helpful if you could comment on how likely it is that a foraging population situated on the coast could have access to one or more productive zone at a time from a single home base. What kinds of distances would they have to travel? Or, how often would they need to move camp to have access to a productive zone? Some comment on this would be helpful in understanding ease of access to carbohydrate resources.Line 233, \"...with carbohydrate on offer at this time\" awkward and unclear phrasing.Discussion has missed many relevant ethnographic texts pertaining to plant foraging in sub-saharan Africa, such as Silberbauer 1981 \"Hunter and Habitat in the Central Kalahari\" and Youngblood 2004 Economica Botany vol. 58Dominy et al. 2008 is overused to support concepts about digestibility of foods which it does not deal with (ex: lines 282, 304), and instead Dominy et al. 2008 is about mechanical properties of African USOs and minor exploration in changes as a result of flash cooking. There are many more topical publications on both cooking and digestibility of plant foods that should be used in the relevant discussion sections.

Comments:Review of \"Ecological interactions and the Netflix problem\" by Desjardins-Proulx et al.The authors consider two different modelling approaches for predicting biotic interactions in ecological communities. The first is a \"recommendation\" approach based on the Netflix problem that uses information about the traits and feeding interactions of a focal species' nearest neighbours to predict possible interactions involving the focal species. The second is a supervised learning approach called random forests that uses only information on species' traits to predict possible interactions across the entire community. The authors find that predictions are not significantly improved by including species' traits in the recommendation approach. For the random forest approach, only three traits (body mass and two variables for species phylogeny) were required to predict interactions with high accuracy. The authors conclude by suggesting that the two approaches are complementary, and that further work should focus on developing techniques that use supervised learning to inform a refined subset of species for consideration in recommendation algorithms.The manuscript is clear and well-written. The idea of using recommendation algorithms for predicting species interactions is new and represents and interesting application of machine learning techniques in ecology. I have one major comment about justifying the inclusion of the supervised machine learning approach, along with suggestions for improvement in this regard. If this comment is addressed, then I would be supportive of publication in PeerJ.-- Justifying the inclusion of the supervised machine learning approachThe focus of the manuscript is clearly the recommendation approach, which the authors contrast with a supervised learning approach. However, the authors note that the two approaches \"are not directly comparable\" (P3L71). Although I think it's valuable to compare the recommendation approach to a different approach, this inability to directly compare the two approaches somewhat undermines the motivation for including the random forest analysis in the manuscript. As a reader, I felt like the two approaches were being described and presented in parallel to one another, and for most of my read-through it was not really clear what the link was between the two approaches. I don't think the paper would lose much by cutting the random forest analysis altogether. However, the inclusion of the supervised learning approach (random forests) becomes clearer towards the end of the manuscript, where the authors suggest that \"the solution to the [recommendation] approach in ecology is likely to *learn* distance metrics instead of using a fixed formula\" (P13L207).I think the manuscript would benefit greatly from the authors attempting even a simple demonstration of their idea. For example, they could use a combination of body size, Ph0 and Ph1 (the most informative traits from their random forest analysis) to measure distances, then use this learned distance matrix to make prey-set comparisons as in the recommendation approach (i.e., instead of the Tanimoto distance). This would be an interesting analysis in its own right, and would also serve to justify the inclusion of the random forest approach in the manuscript.-- Minor commentsSpelling or grammar suggestions are prefaced by \"s/g:\"P1L10. s/g: \"who-eats-whom\"P1L17. Without knowing that there are 882 species in the food web under consideration, it is not immediately clear what the number \"881\" represents. Also, this sentence needs to be explained more fully, as is done on P3L72. (Side note: Are there 882 or 881 species under consideration? On P3L65, the authors suggest that \"881 [species] are involved in predator-prey relationships\" but elsewhere it is noted that there are 882 species, e.g., P4L89.)P2 Introduction.

Food Webs and Niche Space.

I don't fully understand the example presented in the caption of Table 3. Comparing Species 0 to Species 70, the authors suggest that the distance to Species 70 is w_t 0.5 + (1 - w_t) 1/3. By my application of the Tanimoto similarity (Eqn 1), the similarity between the set of traits is 1/2 (ok); but the similarity between the set of preys is 2/4 = 1/2 (Species 42 and 47 are shared, out of the total set of Species 6, 42, 47 and 812). So where does the 1/3 come from (I contend that it should be 1 - 1/2 = 1/2)? Are the authors using the number of preys of Species 0 as the denominator? If so, this needs to be made clear, especially as it is then no longer consistent with the definition of the Tanimoto similarity.P7L129. \"To test the approach, we randomly remove an interaction for each species and ask the algorithm to recommend up to 10 preys for the species with the missing interaction.\" The authors should add more details. For example, are interactions removed one-at-a-time or all-in-one-go? Is similarity calculated before or after removal?P14L227. I think the authors mean \"sensitivity\" rather than \"sensibility\" here (and similarly on P14L234).P14L228. s/g: \"This is caused by ...\"P14L241. s/g: \"... if two species will interact while ...\"P14L244. \"... our results show that binary interactions are mostly independent of the community, since we are able to effectively predict if two species interact given only three traits.\" I think this is an overly strong assertion by the authors. It might well be the case that the traits used to make predictions about binary interactions have been shaped by community factors, especially when the mentioned traits involve taxonomy and phylogeny.                                                ", "The manuscript is clearly written and is well organised. I do miss some references, and of course some lines on this, about other approaches that have used species traits in identifying resource species for consumers in food webs and other ecological networks.  Even if this manuscript is more of a methods paper this about using traits is such an important part that it deserves some more attention I believe. One example paper is Ekl&#246;f et al, 2013, Ecol Lett \"The dimensionality of food webs\" who used traits of various identities to predict interactions. Then we of course have the large body of literature using body size/mass                 The research question is clearly started and defined and the methods are well described and easy to follow.However, I am curious of why exactly these traits (listed in Table 2) were chosen? On line 96 it is stated \"selected traits based on their potential role in consumption interactions\", but to me this is not a good enough explanation. The traits show a huge span in how detailed they are, and some of them I would not even refer to as \"traits\". For example the taxonomy entities is clearly a proxy for numerous traits, and the same for the phylogenetic distances. (This also opens up for some discussion on using phylogeny in predicting interactions, e.g, work by L-F Bersier and colleagues.) It becomes clear when looking at the results for the random forest analyses the complexity captured by these \"traits\" as the accuracy only can be achieved with Ph0 and Ph1.                 One criticism, that the authors also mention themselves, is that it would be interesting to also test this on a different data set - one that is not including only soil food webs (as these tend to be a bit special). However as the paper is a description of the methodology, and not focus on the specific results, it is not urgent to add more data.

Must include it. It is particularly important for the new species described. Describing new species based on just few specimens can be undesired since small variations as shell outline or colour may represent individual phenotypical variation instead of interspecific variation of characters.- For some species is given an estimative of the number of analysed specimens (e.g. Bostryx erythrostoma, 30+ specimens).

Are those references the only studies concerning the species studied here or are those references the only studies concerning the Atacama desert (and also the species studied here)? There is a huge difference between both statements since if the second one is the case, the distribution of these species can be bigger than the restricted area cited here. - Author gave descriptive morphometrical data for the examined species, but no statistical tests were performed to analyze the significance of such morphometric variation. Of course, it is out of the scope of this manuscript (which is already a big work and a great contribution), but author are encouraged to think about a second manuscript analysing such variation among the species from Atacama desert and how this variation can be related to the areas habited by each species.

This specific topic has also not been reviewed before. The intro nicely outlines the motivation for the study. Indeed, the entire manuscript is very well written.                 I found no major flaws in the analysis, but I think more insights could be gained from the analyses.                 I cannot recommend to accept the manuscript in its current form, because it is not correct to talk about &#8220;gene flow&#8221; when the reviewed studies actually analyze genetic structure, and also because I found the discussion to be too general and not specifically related to the findings of the shown analysis. I provide details comment on these issues under point 4 of this review form and encourage the authors to resubmit the manuscript after revisions.             Comments:Major comments1) I do not like how the manuscript talks about &#8220;gene flow&#8221;, but actually compares measures of genetic differentiation and structure. Especially the population-based metrics (e.g., Jost D, FST etc.) are not only affected by gene flow, but also by drift, which is essentially a function of (effective) population size. This is well-known from basic population genetic theory, but the importance of this for landscape genetic inferences was recently highlighted by Prunier et al . - Methods in Ecology and Evolution &#8220;Contribution of spatial heterogeneity in effective population sizes to the variance in pairwise measures of genetic differentiation&#8221;). Similarly, individual-based metrics are not only influenced by gene flow, but also by mating schemes, space-use behavior etc., especially across small spatial scales. You need to explain this in the discussion of your manuscript, so that readers are not misinterpreting your results. I recommend to not talk about &#8220;gene flow&#8221; at all, but instead about &#8220;genetic connectivity&#8221; in a broader sense or even about &#8220;genetic structure&#8221;, and then explain what exactly this entails (i.e., gene flow and other processes).2) One general concern I have is the combination of data/results from plant and animal species. I realize that it is currently difficult to draw cross-species conclusions, but I don&#8217;t think it is correct to combine results from flying and non-flying insects, from plants and animals, and from terrestrial and aquatic systems without at least discussing the importance of different species traits for landscape genetic patterns. Also, you mention biases in previous studies, but you also have a strong bias towards insects in your quantitative analysis (Fig. 7 and 8, Data S2 and S3). You need to discuss this in much more detail. There is an interesting paper by Lino et al. that was recently published in Mammalian Biology (&#8220;A meta-analysis of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on genetic diversity in mammals&#8220;). It focused in genetic diversity and mammals, but you still might want to check out that paper and potentially include it as one of your references.3) In addition to considering species traits, some more details on the studies are warranted. For example, in lines 163-164: I think in order to make sense of such counter-intuitive results, readers would appreciate more details on a) the study design employed by each study, especially concerning the spatial scale of analysis and the sampling scheme, and b) the study species (see above). For example, a small scale analysis on flying insects is much less likely to find an effect of habitat loss than a large scale analysis of ground beetles. You explain this for one of the studies (on army ants) later in the discussion, but it is important for all the studies you use.4) Finally, I found the discussion to be too general. It is basically a list of things that should happen in landscape genetics (use of improved methods, use of NGS approaches, considering time-lags&#8230;). The need to consider all of this has been highlighted before and it is not clear exactly how tropical systems are different or how your study added to this existing knowledge. Thinking some more about the implications of species traits and study design might help you to get more info out of the analyses, but I already think there is a bit more in your data than you report. Isn&#8217;t it interesting that the bias towards mammals is strongest outside of the Americas? Isn&#8217;t it surprising that most amphibian studies use haplotype data? You could also discuss that several studies have used habitat suitability to estimate resistances, but suitability is often a poor descriptor of functional connectivity, so you could advise against this for future tropical studies. I found it surprising that no study has looked at road effects in reptiles, and no amphibian study assessed dispersal via waterways. I also think that a more detailed overview of study aims and outcomes would be nice. You mention these briefly in lines 224-229, but it the info is missing from the results. Overall, I suggest to derive more novel insights from the results you have already obtained and can additionally obtain by considering species traits and study design more explicitly.Minor comments:57: In the sentence &#8220;While these metrics underpin ecosystem function, they are not always be&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; either delete the &#8220;be&#8221;, or change to &#8220;While these metrics underpin ecosystem function, they MAY not always be&#8230;&#8221;119: Not sure why you are citing the Balkenhol et al. 2016 book here. Perhaps a better citation would be chapter 3 in that book (i.e., Waits &amp; Storfer &#8220;Basics of population genetics: quantifying neutral and adaptive genetic variation for landscape genetic studies&#8221;. (Also, the Balkenhol et al book is listed twice in the reference list (a + b)&#8230;)123: Fig. 1 does not show which studies are individual- vs. population-based.139: Please explain why you did not perform a more formal meta-analysis.145: But looking at Figure 2 and Data S1, it really seems like the bias is mostly towards amphibians, while mammals, reptiles and insects are all rather similarly represented. I&#8217;d change your conclusions accordingly. Also see my comment on Fig. 1 concerning a mammal bias outside of the Americas. 146-148: I don&#8217;t understand what this sentence means. Please reword to make it clearer.165-166: It would be important to know whether studies tested for IBD separately, or after accounting for the effects of landscape variables. After all, straight-line and effective distances are often highly correlated and when testing for IBD separately, it will be supported, even if the actual driver is the landscape matrix. 170: Is &#8220;isolation by deforestation&#8221; the same as detecting a positive effect of forest cover on gene flow? If so, I would reword to &#8220;isolation by non-forest&#8221;, because non-forest is a pattern (just like elevation), while deforestation is a process.176: Most studies have focused on amphibians.182: Citing Dyer 2015 here is not appropriate, because he actually argued that thus far, landscape genetics has not evolved into a truly distinct and independent discipline. Aside, I suggest to change &#8220;interdisciplinary discipline&#8220; to &#8222;interdisciplinary field&#8220;.188: Amphibians yes, but mammals not too much more than insects or reptiles.194-208: While I agree that the future will see many more landscape genetic studies using NGS approaches and resulting SNPs, this whole paragraph deals with a very general aspect of landscape genetic s and is only marginally related to your own study. I suggest to shorten this and move it to the very end of the discussion.211: Might be good to mention some of these improved methods, especially some that were not yet mentioned by Richardson et al. (e.g., commonality analysis &#8211; Prunier et al.,Molecular Ecology (2015) 24, 263&#8211;283; extended causal modeling - Fourtune et al. Am Nat. (2018) 191:491-508). This is again something quite general.213-214: This is incorrect. More than one variable can be partialled out in a partial Mantel test before assessing the effect of the focal variable. See e.g., the implementation of partial Mantel tests in r package &#8216;ecodist&#8217;.215: But see Franckowiak et al. 2017 (PLoS ONE 12(4): e0175194) for a severe critique of model selection with pairwise data.216: Add &#8220;models&#8221; after &#8220;population effects (MLPE)&#8221;223: Again, I don&#8217;t think the Balkenhol et al. 2016 book is a good reference for this statement.240: No, species with limited dispersal are not generally expected to be most impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation &#8211; it all depends on the scale of habitat loss, and species with high dispersal capability will also be highly susceptible to habitat loss. See also Evers and Didham (Biol. Rev. (2006), 81: 117&#8211;142 ; Fig. 2B) and Lino et al. (Mammalian Biology, A meta-analysis of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on genetic diversity in mammals).263: I wonder whether it is desirable / realistic to have one modelling framework for all landscape genetic studies. I feel that landscape genetic studies are too diverse for this in terms of spatial and temporal sampling scheme, scale of sampling, landscape and species characteristics, etc.Fig. 1: It looks as if the vast majority of studies outside of the Americas has focused on mammals. This is another bias you might want to report.Fig. 3: Need to mention that 2018 was not yet complete by the time you did this analysisFig. 4: A pie chart would be more appropriate for this figureFig. 5: Need to explain the abbreviations of the different methodsFig. 7: It is not clear to me whether the significances shown by the different symbols are for the effects size (as shown in S3), or for the statistical tests in the original studies.

Would it be better to order by species names, or even to move this mix of taxa to the supplement and here focus on a few species for which multiple landscape variables were tested?

Also, it would be important to know what level of analysis the studies used (pops or individuals), how many analytical units they had (a study with 600 individuals conducting population-based analyses with 3 populations has an effective N of 3) and whether the study was included in your quantitative analysis (because the citations are not listed in S3&#8230;).

The main findings are a decrease in cortisol levels over time, and quite strong interactions between age and maternal high blood pressure/ intrauterine growth retardation / C-section. In these three conditions cortisol is higher shortly after birth, and much lower after the age of two weeks. The authors suggest that these changes indicate reprogramming of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and that this may be relevant for disease vulnerability in later life.The manuscript represents a further analysis of earlier reported studies. It is purely descriptive but seems well-controled (this reviewer is not a methodological specialist in this area). And: the research question is in fact a very interesting one, and bears relevance beyond the acute setting of the obstetrics ward. There is a substantial research community focusing on HPA axis changes in relation to adult stress (PTSD) and on &#8216;early life stress&#8217; in relation to behavioural changes.  The initially higher cortisol levels, developing towards lower levels may well bear relevance to those fields.I have only very minor comments on the manuscript as is. It struck me that glucocorticoid therapy (outside the exclusion period of  one week earlier) has no significant impact by itself. Can the authors discuss this? It would also be of interest to know what the effects of GCs would be at shorter notice (apparently a week suffices for the HPA axis to normalize, but how fast does this happen?). But probably these children were excluded beforehand, and no measurements are available.l.69 What is meant with &#8216;the remote period&#8217;?l.177: &#8216;recent studies&#8217; refers to two papers that are &gt;20 years old                                                ", "The article failed to meet in standards in providing enough evidence, rationale and background for both the study rationale and interpreration of the results.Overall the article flow was hard to follow                 The research question needed to be reworded for clarity (i.e. maternal stress, see comments below) and it wasn't clear how it filled a gap nor was substantively different from their previously published workMethods and Statistical Analysis needed more detail                 Impact and novelty of data weren't properly discussed and test statistics were missing for all presented data             Comments:Title1)\tDoesn&#8217;t seem IV is antenatal stress, but rather prenatal clinical conditions- see comment 15 as well2)\tAssociation is also likely a more accurate term than Influence.

Here are a few examples that I noted, with some suggestions:32- A quibble- Maybe replace marine nutrients with &#8220;marine energy and nutrients.&#8221;  The nutrients are important for vegetation, but most vertebrates are more limited by energy.  This is why bears will excrete most of the nitrogen in their urine.  36- Another citation for the diversity of species used by salmon- Shardlow and Hyatt, 2013, Ecological Indicators38 &#8211; &#8230;for mobile consumers that move among runs&#8230; is maybe more clear39-41- unclear42- Change dispersion to distribution. 58- Although not conclusive, Schindler et al. 2013 suggests that bears also migrate to track resource pulses76-78-   You should note that the tendency for bears to &#8220;high grade&#8221; and only eat 25% of carcasses only occurs when salmon are both abundant and easy to catch.  If not, bears will tend to eat almost everything.  This is an important distinction because there is likely a threshold of salmon abundance below which bears will not leave anything for scavengers.   128-  weighed-&gt; weighted 225- &#8220;integrate over..&#8221;  is a bit confusing.  Maybe something like &#8220;bears maximize their annual energy balance by depositing fat during salmon abundance and hibernating during food scarcity&#8221;Fig. 2- Missing the letter G, so the labels don&#8217;t match the fig. legendOther- the spatiotemporal pattern of salmon spawning is important to understanding this paper.  It might be helpful to show this with a multi-panel map showing where salmon are available during multiple time periods (e.g., summer, fall, winter). This would highlight the relative scarcity of salmon in late fall/winter.                 Although I appreciate the objective of this paper, I don't think that the methods employed allow you to make the conclusions you make.  The most important comments that address these issues are below (151, 171). 125-132-  You are still overestimating the number of individuals using these areas, unless you are assuming that bears (and the other species) don&#8217;t hang around in one spot for more than 2 minutes.  This is unreasonable given past research on the length of bear fishing bouts (Gende and Quinn, 2004; mean fishing bout length of 46 min. for dominant bears).  If a bear fished for this duration in a location where it will trigger your camera, you might conclude that 23 unique bears visited the sites.  However, I don&#8217;t think this is a problem if you re-frame what you are measuring.  Rather than call them &#8220;unique visits&#8221; instead treat your data as an index of use of the salmon resource.  Thus, a bear that walks past your camera will trigger it once, but is unlikely to stick around if there are no salmon.  I think it is safe to assume that the number of detections correlates with the amount of use, even if it is the same few individuals.  133-  Were carcasses placed at each camera throughout the entire season, or just for the period corresponding to the nearby run? 142-144-  Here, with only a single carcass, the five minute threshold may discriminate between unique groups of bears, but a raven or magpie might take a long time to consume a carcass.  151-  These results and interpretation hinge on three important assumptions that are not mentioned in the methods.  1) each species is equally likely to trigger the infrared motion sensor on the cameras; 2) camera trigger rates (detection rates) for a given species are equal across sites; and 3) the viewsheds of each camera are equal.  Unfortunately, I think all of these assumptions are violated by the methods used.  Assumptions 1 and 2 - If species-specific trigger rates were the same across all sites (a raven was equally likely to trigger a camera at a stream than on a river flat) then the violation of this assumption would not prevent comparing the pattern of use of ravens across habitats.  However, when detection varies by habitat differently for different animals, this is a problem.  At close range I expect all species to have similar change of triggering the cameras.  For this reason I think the stream data is likely the best for comparing among species.  At longer distances, however, an eagle may be more likely to trigger the camera than a magpie, making comparisons between species at these sites less reliable. Assumption 3-  While this assumption is violated, it does not change your results as long as you stick to comparing among species at a single site, as you do for ravens on line 159.149-  this variation could be because of variation in motion triggers because of different distances to cameras rather than variation in patterns of use.  171- In this paragraph you implicitly use the detection rates of your road-side cameras as estimates of relative abundance of several species within your study area.  I don&#8217;t think this is valid; relative detection rates may vary as a function of differences in habitat selection among species.  For example, black and brown bears may differentially avoid roads due to the risk of running into people.  This would be better supported if you had a rough estimate of black vs. brown bear abundances for your study area.                 Here are some specific notes.  42-43-  Yes, integration of wildlife and salmon management is very important.  153-154   This is likely a function of availability.  Even though bears are less efficient when fishing at lake shores, they will if those are the only salmon available.  Was this the case?  If not, subordinate bears or sows with cubs may choose a poorer fishing habitat to avoid intraspecific competition or infanticide (Ben-David et al. 2004).  163-164-   Okay because you are making a relative comparison and you were detecting ravens throughout the period, and I&#8217;d expect ravens, gulls, magpies and stellar&#8217;s jays to all have the same likelihood of triggering the cameras.  167-170-  I don&#8217;t think the data supports this interpretation.  Yes, there were more brown bears detected at Herman creek, but Herman creek had similar numbers of eagles, more ravens, and more magpies than Klehini flats.  I think it would be more accurate to say that there were more bears detected at Herman creek than Klehini flats, however, you still have the problem of differences in the size of camera viewsheds.  This would be more clear if the x- axes of figure 3 were all the same.  Again, comparisons across species and sites might be due to a confounding relationship between species-specific detection probability and site.   173-177-  Yes, and this result agrees with some past research on the subject (Fortin et al. 2007).197-202-  Nice, this addresses my earlier comment. 203-  I like that you address the implications of a multi-salmon species system on consumers, but I would be careful about saying that you can fish the less valued species more intensively because they are all equally used by bears.  Gende et al. (2004, Oikos) documented bears selecting salmon with higher fat content because they were a more beneficial resource; my personal observation is that bears prefer kings&gt; coho&gt; sockeye&gt; chums&gt; pinks.  Assuming this reflects the nutritional benefit of each species, this suggests that you cannot exchange a coho for a pink and not harm bears.  Another interpretation of your results is that bears and human fishermen likely benefit from the diversity of salmon species in this area.  Schindler et al. (2010) showed how like life history diversity within sockeye salmon populations created a population portfolio that benefited predators and commercial fishers.  Run timing diversity extended the duration of salmon availability to wildlife consumers and annual returns were more stable for wildlife and commercial fisheries because of the so called &#8220;portfolio effect.&#8221;  These effects may be even more beneficial to consumers in your system because it involves multiple salmon species.  209- 210- Yes, a perfect example of how multiple salmon species system can extend the duration of access to salmon for bears. 213- This paragraph is interesting.  224-  Or, are the other species just less conspicuous?233-235- nice238-243-  Salmon are likely important to mink population productivity (Ben David, 2011), but their use of salmon is more difficult to observe than a bear or eagle.  248-251-  I strongly disagree.  Salmon species are not equally valuable as a resource, nor are salmon spawning in different areas equally available.  You are assuming that the number of detections of an bear at a location is always correlated with the value of the resource.  Contrast the number of times you would detect a bear that spends an hour to catch a sockeye salmon spawning on a lake shore versus a bear that can easily catch pink salmon in a shallow stream.  The bear at the stream may become satiated in 45 minutes and go take a nap while the other bear fishes for hours.  You would detect the lake shore bear many more times, but the pink salmon population is clearly more valuable to the bear.  253-256-  Good point.             Comments:Because of problems with the experimental design, I don't think that the findings are valid.  I think this paper could be rewritten to focus just on contrasting the patterns of detection of bears and eagles across time (the other species distract from the clear contrast between bears and eagles).  The problems with the methodology (comment 151 above) can be minimized if you pooled detections across sites with a given period of availability (e.g. late chum, early pink) and normalized the number of detections between zero and one (divide by max daily detections of a species) to account for differences in probability of detection.  With these changes I think you could contrast the patterns of use (bears used salmon during all time periods, while eagles focused on late chum, reflecting their different life history strategies).  If this study is ongoing, it would be better to use time lapse photography instead of motion trigger, or, pair a motion trigger camera with a video camera to check whether detection probability varies by species and/or site.

The observations, though relatively basic, are valuable to our understanding of the direct effects of salmon subsidies. I look forward to seeing this work published and I hope to see more basic natural history work given some of the holes in our understanding of salmon subsides.Since this paper is putatively about vertebrate consumers, it would be helpful if it would make a small effort to consider the work that has been done on vertebrate consumers that lack feathers and fur. Stream ecologists have done most of the work on salmon subsidies, and they may be confused by the terminology in this manuscript and its tendency to ignore prior work in freshwater environments. For example, the list of vertebrate consumers in the intro does not include fishes!  I realize that PeerJ is about getting the data out there and less about placing results in a broader context, but as long as the format is going to include a results and discussion section, I think it&#8217;s reasonable to expect manuscripts to make a decent attempt at placing new material within the context of existing work. See comments below for specific examples. While I agree that this paper has some management implications, the discussion does not put forward arguments that are either logically strong, or well supported by existing work. The paper makes little attempt to reference existing work that considers how fisheries can affect salmon availability across space and time (i.e.  Doctor et al. 2010 Trans. Am. Fish Soc., Boatright et al. 2004 Trans. Am. Fish. Soc.) or how salmon abundance affects consumer foraging opportunities (Bentley et al. 2012 Ecosphere).Specific Comments12: &#8220;distinct life histories&#8221; seems like an overstatement, many salmon consumers opportunistic foragers34: what about fishes?39: I didn&#8217;t totally follow this sentence48: Smaller birds have higher caloric demands per unit body mass51: the phrase distinct life-histories is used a few times but I don&#8217;t get much meaning out of it58: Don&#8217;t eagles also deposit fat (though not to the same degree) and don&#8217;t bears also track asynchronous run-timings? Lisi et al. 2012 Geomorphology showed that substantial phenological variation in salmon can be expressed over small spatial extents, within the range of consumers with modest mobility. In fact due to limited spatial autocorrelation in salmon phenology, the relationship between spatial extent and salmon phenological extent may asymptote within a bear&#8217;s home range. 64: I&#8217;ve seen &gt;70 bears on a 3 km stream with the last run of salmon in a watershed, I&#8217;m not sure that late season aggregations are unique to eagles. 69: the effects of stream size on bear predation is well documented by Quinn, Carlson, Hendre and others and could be cited here. 69: Habitat features have been shown to strongly influence whether fishes can exploit salmon subsidies: Armstrong et al. 2010 Ecology Thermal heterogeneity mediates the effects of pulsed subsidies across a landscape&#8230;83: What is a pool off of a larger river? Floodplain habitat?89: a sentence reiterating the methodologies would be helpful, so that we know what monitoring an individual carcass means.93: I&#8217;d never heard of lake-spawning coho salmon, are you sure they are spawning along the lake sure and not simply aggregating there? Interesting regardless.96: How were the salmon breeding phenologies determined?114: Not a big deal, but usually freshwater scientists don&#8217;t call small bodies of flowing water &#8220;creeks&#8221;, they call them &#8220;streams&#8221; and only use creek in the name. 116: It&#8217;d be nice if you could define what you mean by a pool in terms that would make sense to a stream ecologist &#8211; the current definition is likely not what stream ecologists think of as a pool. The results of this paper are relevant to freshwater folks studying salmon subsidies, so to maximize the impact it would help to use clear terminology.139: What was the condition of the carcass or how were they aquired? Since the energy density of spawning salmon declines over time (Hendry and Berg 1999 Can. J. Zool) the state of the carcass could influence its appeal to scavengers.146: I&#8217;m not sure I find the total aggregate # of images useful, but since it&#8217;s listed I&#8217;m curious of whether false triggers are included and whether the cameras worked continuously and were never taken out by bears or ran out of batteries. 154: Quinn et al. 2001 do not suggest that bears do not feed along large rivers or lake shores, but instead that they exert lower predation rates on salmon in these habitats. I don&#8217;t think that the observation that bears still show up at rivers and lakes shores will be surprising to anyone, and it has also been documented in the literature. I&#8217;m not saying that this documentation is not a worthy contribution for natural history, just that it shouldn&#8217;t be pitched as contrary to the results of Quinn et al. 2001 at least not without more nuance. 170: The tricky part about making inferences from these data is that we don&#8217;t know all the salmon foraging habitats that were within the foraging neighborhoods of these consumers&#8212;if the birds didn&#8217;t show up at a small stream with a camera on it, was that because they don&#8217;t like small streams, or because they were on another small stream where a camera was not present? I&#8217;m not saying that these data don&#8217;t provide insights, but if the authors could address this potential issue it would make their arguments stronger.  185: If brown bears are quickly grabbing many of the carcasses, how does that affect the inference of scavenging by other consumers? Would you see potentially different results if you surrounded the carcasses with electric fences permeable to small carnivores?192: What would prevent eagles from foraging in forested habitats? I&#8217;m just curious since they seem invulnerable to predation from all but bears, but they do seem to prefer open habitats.197: I&#8217;ve noticed that the time of year strongly influences whether bears will consume carcasses left as bait. In unpublished studies of maggot scavenging dynamics, bears would grab a carcass within a couple hours at the very beginning of the salmon runs. In contrast (and intuitively) during the peak of the runs, most carcasses left out were not scavenged.203: I am skeptical that managers would get much traction by arguing that a recent study showed bears fed on a variety of salmon runs, and therefore fishing levels should decline. The argument for backing off of chum and pink runs is interesting and perhaps ecologically valid, but those aren&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;low value&#8221; species. They may be on a per pound basis, but certainly the aggregate value of pink and chum fisheries can be substantial. Further, many Alaskans (whether native, Caucasian, &#8220;urban&#8221;, and rural) have little interest in maximizing brown bear productivity, but are very concerned about salmon yields.  213: Could the absence of consumers on early runs be related to other factors, such as constraints due to reproduction, or use of alternative food sources? For example some herbivores catch the &#8220;green wave&#8221; late and leave it early, presumably due to trade-offs between resource tracking and arrival at breeding sites (Kolzsch et al. 2015 J Anim. Ecol.)228: it&#8217;s not clear whether this is speculation or backed by existing data or studies234: the term integrate is confusing when applied to energy allocation242: Seems worth noting that salmon carcasses are likely much lower in energy density than the alternative prey of small carnivores&#8212;a spawned out salmon is about  ~3 kJ/g (Hendry and Berg 1999) whereas a rodent is about 2-3-times as energy dense (Cox and Secor 2007, Comp. Biochem. Phys A). Foraging theory suggests that the abundance of preferred prey (not alternative prey) influences prey switching, which in turn suggests that small carnivores might only switch to salmon when rodent cycles are in their low phase. See Lisi et al. 2013 Ecology of Freshwater Fish for twist on fish switching to rodent prey during years with low salmon abundance.248: Combining all salmon biomass when managing for salmon misses the point that certain salmon populations have disproportionate importance to consumers, which I thought was a key point of this paper. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s feasible to manage salmon fisheries for specific populations, but it would certainly seem important to avoid management practices that are likely to hammer specific populations, for example the common practice of meeting escapement goals and then heavily harvesting late arriving fish. 255: these results seem overstated, I would say &#8220;would likely&#8221; but &#8220;will&#8221; is not demonstrated by these data.Figure 1: Can you color or symbol the sites by run timing and or species                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.6738": ["The paper is based on a  thorough analysis of a data set, that is available for re-examination, using state-of-the-art  statistical techniques.  The English expression is of a high quality and the citations are appropriate.                 The design of the experiment is appropriate to address the very narrow question of the relative importance of site and disturbance (grazing and fire) ion plant species composition and richness.                 My concern with this paper is that the study does not tackle the fundamental question in pyrodiversity and pyric herbivory &#8211; how spatial scale of burning affects grazing, and if there is a self-reinforcing feedback with post fire grazing through changed fuel arrays.  To do this would require information of the effect of fire patch size on grazing and fire hazard (flammability) of vegetation.  So this paper makes a useful point about the importance of underlying physical gradients in shaping plant species distribution and plant community composition but I do not believe it directly tests the core ideas of pyrodiversity and pyric herbivory.  The Discussion needs, therefore, to be more balanced in light of the very narrow focus of this study objectives and design.             Comments:I would scale back the claims of this paper as being a major test of pyric herbivory and pyrodiversity, rather it looks at some facets of these complicated ideas.  The authors should reflect on the caveats with their study and thereby temper their recommendations for managers.  More thought about the biological processes leading to the results would strengthen this paper (i.e. why do some species prosper under some disturbance and edaphic regimes while other species do not).                                                ", "Overall, well written with scattered minor typos. Meets all the criteria listed by PeerJ.                 Seems fine - nice use of long-term vegetation dataMichael Palmer is the go-to guy for multivariate analysis of vegetation data, in particular, and I suspect Daniel McGlinn knows his stuff, as well.                 See general comments below.             Comments:This manuscript describes an analysis of the effectiveness of &#8220;pyroherbivory&#8221; in maintaining species diversity in grass-grazer ecosystems. The authors test two assumptions: 1) fire and grazing create spatial variability in community structure, and 2) species composition of patches diverge through time in response to these disturbances. Using long-term data from permanent vegetation sampling plots, they find that underlying heterogeneity in soil chemistry, as a proxy for abiotic variability, had a much larger impact on vegetation structure and variability than did patch grazing, as did interannual variation in precipitation. However, patch grazing did have some slight positive effect on species richness. They conclude that &#8220;fine tuning&#8221; a patch grazing management scheme may provide limited benefits to maintain grassland plant species richness. This is a very nicely written and easy to follow manuscript that addresses some interesting aspects of the patch-grazing model for rangeland management. This pyroherbivory approach was actually developed and promoted by colleagues of the authors at Oklahoma State, and it has been widely promoted as a way to enhance species diversity without negatively affecting cattle production. The effectiveness of this approach certainly deserves analysis. The patch-grazing model does have strong underlying logic. Traditional grazing approaches promote uniform grazing across a pasture, which logically should result in lower spatial heterogeneity and lower species diversity at the pasture scale. Patch grazing, on the other hand, driven by a rotational burning of subsets of a pasture each year to create different aged patches that are grazed to different degrees will increase heterogeneity and thus pasture scale species diversity. The approach has been tested in many systems on various taxa, and as the authors point out evidence for the success of this approach is mixed. In the case of the current manuscript the authors find that underlying physical environment has a larger effect than the management scheme, although patch grazing did have a statistically small positive effect. As far as I can tell from the literature and that reviewed in this manuscript, the pyroherbivory approach results in either neutral or positive impacts to some degree, but it never has a negative effect, so in that regard it seems reasonable to suggest the approach has some benefits when implemented, but do the costs of that management scheme justify the benefits? Is the focus on the statistical contribution in your model a valid assessment of whether or not this approach is useful in practice? Where I am a bit confused by this manuscript is assumption (2) that says patches should diverge in composition over time. Either I don&#8217;t understand the pyroherbivory scheme or that assumption is not correct. The authors need to better explain how that assumption works since it is one of the 2 main questions in this manuscript. Here&#8217;s my confusion. Again, if a manager burns the entire pasture every year and spreads water and salt licks throughout, then uniform grazing will occur and heterogeneity will be low. Patch burning, for example, would divide the pasture into six units, two of which would be burned each year essentially creating 6 patches that are all burned every three years. Within any given year the treatments would create spatial heterogeneity and fire refugia because 1/3 of the area would be burned that year, 1/3 would be 1 year post burn and 1/3 would be 2 years post burn. Over time all sections would be subjected to the same 3-year fire rotation and grazing pressure. So why should they diverge? Within any given year the three patch types should diverge in community structure to some degree.The manuscript has scattered typos and a more careful proof reading is needed next time.

Line 233-235, the Authors state: &#8220;Using poly-&#947;-glutamate staining, we discovered nematocyte size variations ranging from 2&#956;m2-110&#956;m2 (Fig. 3D). Because nematocytes increase in size during maturation, small nematocysts tend to be immature nematocysts&#8221; Implying that the small DAPI labeled nematocytes are the immature forms of the larger ones. This is unlikely since poly-&#947;-glutamate in both Clytia and Hydra start accumulating only after the nematocyte capsules are fully formed. The authors here are more likely observing different nematocyte types and not different stages of maturation. This could be checked by analyzing the nematocyte composition of the tentacles.3) The Authors show that Cladonema medusae keep growing for a day after being starved. This has already been described in &#8220;Costello J. 1998. Physiological response of the hydromedusa Cladonema californicum Hyman (Anthomedusa: Cladonemidae) to starvation and renewed feeding. J.

See general comments.             Comments:This paper investigates the role of cell proliferation in growth and regeneration of jellyfish in the hydrozoan cnidarian Cladonema pacifica. The authors used cell proliferation markers EdU and an anti-PhosphoHistone H3 antibody to study the spatial distribution of proliferative cells. In addition, they used hydroxyurea (HU) to pharmacologically inhibit cell proliferation. They find that proliferative cells occur throughout the medusa body, and report a concentration of proliferative cells at the base of tentacles referred to as the tentacle bulb. Moreover, they show that pharmacological perturbation of cell proliferation leads to defects in growth, nematogenesis, and tentacle regeneration in C. pacifica medusae. The authors conclude that C. pacifica medusae possess non-randomly distributed proliferative cells that have necessary roles in development and regeneration. The role of cell proliferation in jellyfish development and regeneration is understudied, and therefore descriptive and functional analyses of proliferative cells in hydrozoan jellyfish reported in this paper are important. I think this paper should be of interest to broad audiences including invertebrate zoologists, evolutionary developmental biologists and regenerative biologists, and thus would be suitable for publication in PeerJ. Overall, I think that the basic reporting requirements are satisfied for the most part; in particular, figures appear to be of high quality. My main concerns relate to 1) the lack of statistics to support authors&#8217; claim that proliferative cells are uniformly distributed in the umbrella and are enriched in tentacle bulbs, 2) the lack of data to rule out the possibility that phenotypes observed in HU-treated animals have resulted from the toxicity of HU treatment, and 3) the lack of data showing the identity of proliferative cells, as discussed below.  1.\tOn the basis of the spatial distribution of EdU- and/or PH3-positive cells, the authors suggest that proliferative cells are uniformly distributed except in the tentacle bulbs where a cluster of proliferative cells, or &#8220;a proliferative zone&#8221;, is observed. However, no statistics (e.g. spatial autocorrelation) was performed to reject the null hypothesis that EdU- and/or PH3-positive cells are distributed randomly throughout the medusa body. Evidence is qualitative. The authors should perform appropriate statistical tests to determine whether the spatial distribution of proliferative cells in medusae is uniform, clustered, or random.2.\tBased on the phenotype observed in HU-treated animals, the authors conclude that cell proliferation is necessary for normal growth, nematogenesis, tentacle morphogenesis and regeneration in C. pacifica medusae. However, the possibility that the observed phenotype in HU-treated animals resulted from the toxicity of HU treatment has not been ruled out. Are HU-treated animals capable of feeding? Are the effects of HU treatment reversible? Addressing these questions is critical for authors&#8217; main conclusion.3.\tAs the authors indicate in the manuscript, postembryonic cell types in hydrozoans can be generated by differentiation of interstitial stem cells (i-cells), or by transdifferentiation of differentiated cells (e.g. striated muscle cells in Podocoryne). It would therefore be important to determine the identity of proliferative cells during growth and regeneration in C. pacifica medusae. Do all, or a subset, of the proliferative cells show morphological hallmarks of i-cells (i.e. high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, the presence of nucleolus, basophilic, etc)? Where exactly are the proliferative cells located? In the ectoderm and/or endoderm? In the tentacle bulb, are proliferative cells enriched on the oral side, the aboral side, or both?Minor points:-Line 240: It is not clear what is meant by &#8220;the rate of small nematocysts.&#8221; Do authors mean the number or proportion, instead of the rate?

The presentation was extremely clear and I have few comments. The assessment of variable importance and parameter estimates for the statistical models is solid and well done. This is a great example of the interface of landscape-scale assessments and field research in order to evaluate impacts of land-use decisions. I think it would be very interesting for a wide variety of readers and could help land managers see how science can be used to better guide land use decisions. As the authors state their results support the intuitive, but not well-tested, hypothesis that the geographic context in which energy is developed can alter the types and levels of impacts such development has on natural systems. As renewable energy, and wind energy in particular, expands rapidly in response to both calls to reduce CO2 emissions as well as the levelized cost of electricity makes wind one of the cheapest forms of new electricity capacity &#8211; it will be critical to proactively consider siting and mitigation of wind energy impacts. Landscape-scale assessments like that described in this manuscript can be used to evaluate impacts needed to guide land-use planning and management decisions. As I stated I have few technical comments &#8211; most of the specific points that I think should be addressed relate to the interpretation and communication of the results.  My biggest concern of the manuscript is that I think it fails to include one of the most significant forms of impact associated with energy development: transmission. In many cases the infrastructure needed to support energy development has a larger impact than the development itself. For example, the US Department of Energy estimates that it will take approximately 5 million hectares to reach 20% electricity production. But it will also take an additional 18,000 kilometers of new transmission lines. The current study examines only the impacts of &#8220;onsite&#8221; transmission features when it is the &#8220;offsite&#8221; transmission that has the largest impact. It would be great to discuss how siting new wind installations near previously altered landscapes may further reduce the impacts from new development.The authors ask the important question is it possible to construct facilities that minimize the levels of habitat loss and fragmentation? Their results do suggest siting facilities in locations with higher levels of existing development can reduce impacts. Several other studies have speculated as to the importance of siting renewable energy on lands already impacted from development in order to reduce impacts given projections of future wind energy development. It would however be good to link the current assessment to these other studies that have estimated this potential &#8211; Kiesecker et al. 2011 (US wide), Fargione et al. 2012 (Northern Great Plains), Baruch-Mordo et al. 2018 (Global).

This can be easily fixed by adding more paragraphs that develop more the idea of pristine environments as well as the productivity in the Galapagos region.- The manuscript would greatly benefit from this literature review, followed by some adjustments in the discussion to make it more appealing to a broader readership.- Data analysis is not sufficiently or clearly explained in the Methods which jeopardize the interpretation of the results presented by the authors.

The penalty is clear.In first place I want to make it clear that I do believe the authors have a very interesting dataset, despite apparent limitations on spatial coverage. There are, however, some key issues that preclude this paper from being published as it is. The main \"finding\" of the present manuscript, and the one that grounds it is that shark biomass on the islands of Darwin and Wolf in the Galapagos Archipelago is the largest ever reported. This statement is based on a multi-study, multi-method comparison of regionally estimated \"magical\" biomass values. Strong inconsistencies and inadequacies are discussed below:1) Political reasoning trampling over science: according to the authors, biomass estimate in Darwin and Wolf Islands is 15.9 t/ ha, a really high value. But when they spatially decompose values from the two islands we see a huge heterogeneity: Darwin \"with\" 28.3 and Wolf \"with\" 6.3 t/ha! Further on in their regional graph comparing measured biomass in the present study with estimates from other places around the world the authors insert the mean value of the two islands. What does this mean means? If we are to put the two islands separately, Wolf would be somewhere near Kingman and not \"that\" special anymore. So what do the authors do? Nothing. They simply ignore this fact and go on considering both islands as an entity because they already know what they pledge: to fully protect these islands from fishing. No matter what they have really measured. This is a valid pledge, with which I completely agree. It should however be done without ignoring their own data, but rather by discussing the reasons behind it.2) Different sampling methods among studies. The present study estimated biomass through diver operated stereo video-system. All other studies&#180; with which they compare are derived from Underwater Visual Census. The authors simply assume both methods are comparable and go on as if there was nothing to worry about. There is a brief mention at the methods that the authors made also UVCs paired with DOVs. This is not mentioned anywhere else in the text so that we wonder whether they really did both methods and if they bothered comparing between them. Then I looked at the Sup. Mat. and discovered the comparison was there! Why is it not at the main text? Did the authors think of it as unnecessary? I think this is an essential part since all of their results sit on the assumption that the methods are comparable, at least for estimating biomass of large-sized or large-schooling fishes. The next question is: are they really comparable? At the Supl. Material the authors only make limited comparisons on absolute estimates of richness, abundance and biomass of each method (and a comparison on estimates of shark size classes). The comparison on biomass reads:\"Similarily, overall relative biomass recorded was not significantly different between methods (W=2341; p-value= 0.421), despite a 57% higher biomass recorded with DOVs (12.40 &#177; 4.01 t ha-1) compared to UVC (7.89 &#177; 2.05 t ha-1).\"So the authors accept a 57% of difference between methods as comparable just because of statistical \"insignificance\"? This is just a result of high variability of the data and small sampling size, not of absence of effect! I am pretty sure if there were more samples, very high differences would be found. Possibly if comparisons were made by site, variability reduction would also allow for differences to be detected. If not, randomization methods can certainly work this out.And then, once the authors show, by their data, that biomass estimates are not directly comparable they will pretty much invalidate their own approach. Probably the only way out is to derive a correction index for their estimates. One thing to note is that if the 57% overestimation stands, \"biomass\" at Darwin and Wolf would be down to ~6.8 t/ha both, with Darwin going to ~12.2 t/ha and Wolf to ~2.7 t/ha. This is a picture VERY different from the one the authors tried to portrait.3) As it is becoming classic in large-scale comparisons of biomass (many of them led by some of the authors here), values for regional comparison are reported without any measure of data dispersion. This is the most basic statistic principle and it is not worth going over it. I known that it is not the authors&#180; intent to statistically test differences. But we known that biomass data is largely overdispersed (the authors recognize this when they try a glmm with gamma distribution) with a lot of extreme values that heavily influence the average. This is due to extreme spatial, temporal and habitat heterogeneity. The point here is: what is the meaning of comparing average biomass from different regional studies in different spatial scales (number of sites sampled, number of stations within a site) and distinct habitats? What is the philosophical point in stating \"biomass in place A is X ton/ha\"? It is much more informative to say that \"biomass in place A varied from X to Y, with concentrated values close to X but some biologically meaningful values closer to Y\". Representing standard error of the mean in a bar chart is a consequence of these inconsistencies and a really effective way of hiding the intrinsic data variability. 4) Estimating shark biomass from non-instantaneous counts. The authors ignore the problems with estimating the biomass of highly mobile fishes (such as sharks) from non-instantaneous counts (Ward-Paige et al. 2010. Overestimating fish counts by non-instantaneous visual censuses. PLoS ONE e11722).In addition to these critical issues, there are some smaller points which also undermine the quality of the manuscript:Use of inadequate statistical analysis: the authors employ a Redundancy Analysis with two categorical variables. Albeit it seems there is no mathematical drawback from this, I cannot see any reason for such an approach since a simpler MDS or PCoA plot with colored groups (the same categories the authors employ as \"environmental variables\") can answer the same questions. To worsen things, one variable (\"exposure\", in fact the direction where surge predominantly comes) is nested within the other. Following the wave of studies employing mixed-modeling, the authors go on with this approach also to test differences between sites. They make a good choice for the generalized model part employing a gamma distribution (adequate for biomass). But then they use a random factor with 2 levels? Please see Brian McGill&#180;s important post with comments on this deadly sin (https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/is-it-a-fixed-or-random-effect/).Figures: data presentation is based on bar charts, an effective way of hiding your data. But ecologists are starting to move on to a new data presentation paradigm. See \"Kick the bar chart habit\" Nature Editorial Vol 11, N&#176; 2, Feb-2014 and Weissgerber et al. (2015) Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm. PLoS Biology. Moreover Figure 1 is a \"frankenstein\" figure, very effective in making the reader confused. There is no ordination between panels. There are no geographical indications, nor even directions. If I did not known where Galapagos and, particularly Darwin and Wolf are, I could NEVER realize based on this figure. It is also completely impossible to assert which island is Darwin and which is Wolf based solely on it. The caption is also useless. Together all this problems result in a paper impossible to be accepted in its current form. I recognize, however, that there is potential on the data if the authors are willing to rework the manuscript and resubmit it.

In other words, how can the Authors be sure that they are not overestimating numbers (and thus biomasses) of highly mobile species as sharks are? In the Excel file there are no dates for the records, but it looks like the data were not taken simultaneously (but at different days).2-Considering that all the data presented correspond to a single month, all comparisons between sites, exposures, oceanographic conditions are highly speculative. Too much attention is placed to those comparisons, which should be performed with at least a series of data from a whole year (including all oceanographic conditions, which fluctuate). Giving so much attention to those circumstantial comparisons deviates the attention of the reader from the main result of the study: the high biomass recorded and the need for conservation measurements.Part of the discussion and the main conclusion of the study (and the most relevant result) must be presented in an improved manner:1-\"the largest fish biomass reported to date worldwide\" must be presented in relation to shore or island systems, because there are well documented fish biomasses greater than the one found in Darwin and Wolf, thus, it is not the largest worldwide: it might be the largest documented on shores or island systems (coral and rocky reef habitats). For example, schools of some tuna species exceed the biomass found by the authors in Darwin and Wolf. They are also apex predators, commonly traveling in open ocean waters, along with other apex predators associated to those tuna schools (i.e., sharks and dolphins).2-in this first part of the discussion the theory of the \"Inverted biomass pyramid\" is presented as the possible explanation of the great biomass supported by the shallow (and adjacent) systems of Darwin and Wolf, suggesting that this higher-than-usual biomass \"can be maintained when the top levels of the food web have a much lower turnover rate (slower growth rate per biomass unit) than their prey\" (quoting Sandin &amp; Zgliczynski, 2015). This explanation seems unlikely. Such \"inverted pyramids\" are usually observed when the system is subsidized by other (sometimes adjacent) system(s). In the case of Darwin and Wolf, the ecology of the most abundant species gives clues on a more plausible explanation. Sphyrna lewini is a very mobile shark, which seems to spend the day close to islands (shallow systems) while moving to deeper waters in search for food during the night. There have been records of individuals from this species moving from one island (i.e., Malpelo) to another (i.e., Galapagos), sometimes covering distances of up to 1000 km in a few days (one paper with such data quoted by the Authors). In the absence of philopatric data, and with just one field trip of data, Authors should be careful when trying to explain the great biomass found. Replicates during at least a whole year should reveal how \"resident\" is the hammerhead sharks' population and, thus, how dependent on the local preys the hammerhead sharks are indeed.Lines 233-235: this sentence is highly speculative, considering that the Authors also say that hammerhead sharks (most abundant species = highest biomass) is not a \"resident\" species. The sentence is implying that those sharks feed on gringos and other local \"resident\" species, but this is not supported by the data presented (also see the comment on the trophic ecology of this shark above).Lines 309-310: Authors should consider rephrasing the sentence \"That makes sharks alive in Gal&#225;pagos the most valuable on Earth.\", because this conclusion arises from data that were not intended to estimate an economic value. Moreover, as hammerhead sharks migrate and leave Darwin and Wolf (actually they might leave the entire GMR for several months) they should be consider as a \"moving treasure\" in terms of their economic value. If they, for example, migrate to Cocos or to Malpelo, they should be seen as a shared good (as all migratory species are; they don&#180;t belong to a particular country).

If the correlation is positive at an 0.05 level or 0.01 level then it is obvious that the deletions or the observed insertions has a role to play in the selective differentiation of this gene in these species.

I don't think \"longitudinal\" is a good term, but the method is interesting and only scantly used in palaeontology.Methods, from data acquisition to processing should be more clearly reported and/or explained, in particular:1) Concerning the acquisition of growth-related shell outlines from a single valve, the only explanation is \"digitized in different angles\". It is very difficult to orientate valves in order to capture different growth stages (growth line). Are authors sure that outline acquisition was not biased by wrong orientation? Which method did they follow for handling and properly orienting valves? 2) Authors should give more information about the software used to digitize outlines. Further, more importantly, they should specify how many points were used, and how/where the starting point was selected.

The references used provide good context for the reader. Figures are ok (there are some issues with the captions though, pointed out in the attached PDF file). I would like to have a table or two reporting the results from some analyses in the main article (see Experimental design). On the negative side, I was not able to replicate the results reported in the manuscript using the supplementary data provided by the authors. However, my main problem with this article is its deficient English, which needs substantial polishing in order to make the manuscript publishable (I have made several corrections and comments in the attached PDF file aimed in that direction).                 I think this work is good in both intention and execution, as it addresses the study of allometric growth patterns using longitudinal data (a relevant topic in paleobiology that requires accumulation of study cases like this) using an adequate quantitative toolkit (geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics) and discussing relevant/interesting implications (taxonomic, paleobiological, evolutionary). However, there are some issues that need to be addressed. My main concerns are (see also comments in the attached PDF):i) Some passages of the manuscript need further elaboration. In particular the geometric morphometrics paragraph at the end of the Introduction section, as well as discussion relating these study cases to the study of heterochrony at the end of the Discussion section, should be expanded.ii) The report of multivariate regression analysis (MRA) is problematic. The authors do not mention the software they used, and the results reported are not those of an ordinary MRA (e.g., permutations and linear combination of response variables are not typical elements of an ordinary MRA). More thoroughness is needed in this regard to fully understand what the authors did. Also, I think that the information provided in Supplementary Data S4 and S5 regarding MRA should be reorganized as one or two tables and included in the main article, as these results are crucial to describe the covariation between size and shape in the studied taxa.iii) The supplementary material provided by the authors does not allow replication of the procedures and results reported. In the case of Supplementary Data S2, some of the normalized (as I can infer from the name and number of columns) coefficient values from the last columns can not be read. In the case of Supplementary Data S3, it is not clear to me whether the table contains normalized or raw Fourier coefficients: the names of the columns suggest that these have been normalized (as coefficients start at D1), whereas the number of columns (28) and the values of the first three columns of coefficients (invariant when these have been normalized) suggest these are raw. Also, I analyzed the data from Supplementary Data S3 using the Momocs package in R, and was not able to produce the same morphospace as the one shown in Figure 3B.Apart from this I think that, in general, the quantitative tools described in the manuscript have been adequately applied to answer a well defined and relevant question.                 I think this work is a good addition to the literature addressing allometry patterns in fossil species. Concerns regarding MRA aside, the analyses used are an adequate choice for conducting a study of this nature, and interpretation of the results is correct. Findings are appropriately placed within the paleontological context of the study case, and their implications explored to a reasonable extent (with the exception of the discussion of heterochrony mentioned in Experimental design). There is nothing in the conclusions that is not justified from what the authors report. The results and conclusions seem valid to me, although the issue of reproducibility needs to be addressed to be completely sure.

In addition, the limited sample size and the acknowledged preliminary nature of the work places the ms more as an opinion piece than as primary quantitative research.                 This opinion article takes as its base the documented low success rate of wildlife reintroductions to make a case that to date the emphasis has been on the biological drivers of population establishment success, and as a consequence the importance of project leadership and management has been overlooked. Sutton uses the case study of sea eagles in Scotland to propose four managerial elements that he considers to be critical to project success.A total of only 15 (L204) (or 11?, L247) people were interviewed using a semi-structured approach. Interviewees were asked to consider issues that might have been influential to success, thus a subjective assessment is being made by people, in isolation from considering the relative role that biological factors played in outcomes. As written in the Methods L259+ it seems interviews were structured around four themes (confusingly labelled as themes 1-3). Unsurprisingly therefore, the Discussion starts with the conclusion that (L297) these &#8220;four critical factors&#8230;contributed to success&#8221;.  This seems like a  tautology, whereby interviews have been structured around an a priori thesis of what themes are important, leaving no room to refute the hypothesis that these four (3?) themes are critical, no way to discover new themes, and no way to eliminate any of the 3-4 themes discussed. One of  weaknesses of this ms is a failure to consult the latest IUCN guidelines on reintroductions (2012), where considerable emphasis is indeed placed on at least 3 of the four the social aspects Sutton considers to have been overlooked:1.\tLeadership and Management (ref IUCN 2012, Section 5.2)3.\tGoals and Evaluation (ref IUCN 2012, Section 4.1)4.\tAdaptive Public Relations (ref IUCN 2012, Section 8.1, Section 9In addition, it is completely reasonable to highlight the importance of management structures for reintroductions, but seems unnecessary to bolster an argument for doing so by considering that previous reviews have neglected this aspect, failed to consider it, or made assumptions that biological factors are more important. Reviews from over 20 years ago are cited in support of this position, even though 20 years ago the whole field was relatively new and sensibly the focus was on fundamental biological aspects. It would not have made any sense to hone in on management structures while ignoring or downplaying absolutely critical aspects such as founder animal selection and release site habitat matching &#8211; these are and remain key drivers of success and no level of &#8220;political advocacy&#8221; or &#8220;adaptive outreach&#8221; will overcome problems arising because e.g. the original causes of extinction have not bee dealt with.A more reasonable case could have been made by Sutton that, now that critical biological factors are being understood and examined, further gains could be made by looking at the features of management structures that best enable implementation of reintroduction projects that have a good grasp of the key biological aspects to be dealt with. But even here the case is pre-empted by the new IUCN Guidelines.             Comments:I have referenced these points by Line number on the submitted ms.L5\tA &#8220;reintroduction&#8221; is a type of &#8220;translocation&#8221; &#8211; it does not make sense to refer to them as either/or (ref IUCN 2012).L35\tWording makes it seem that previous reviews of reintroduction outcomes have made assumptions about critical factors associated with success, but seminal quantitative reviews such as Griffith and the uncited Wolf et al papers, have been the basis for attention to key biological factors.

The cited success rate includes the very low success for translocations of problem animals and is not representative of reintroductions.L82\tSeem to be setting up a straw man in making an asserting that aspects such as e.g. publication bias, have gone largely unstudied. Even in a sense specific to reintroduction biology this is untrue (e.g. Bajomi 2010).L88\tYour thesis relates to organisational structures, and it is true that early reviews of reintroduction outcomes have not specifically related success to management, but it is not true to say that &#8220;human dimensions&#8221; were ignored. Consideration of the impacts of social acceptability and human actions, in relation to released animals, have been considered, e.g. even as far back as Kleiman 1989. Actually the importance of management structures for reintroductions has been highlighted by Beck (2001) in his review of the first reintroductions of bison in the US.L95\tYou need to make a better case for your assertion that demography, genetics and ecology are not the &#8220;truly decisive factors &#8220; &#8211; surely even the best management structure in the world could not overcome problems arising due to biological factors such as inappropriate habitat selection, inbreeding depression, predation, disease etc.L98\tYou are trying too hard to criticise previous work &#8211; the quote is not &#8220;skeptical&#8221; it simply acknowledges a lack of data necessary to adequately assess management influence on reintroduction outcomes.L108\tReading et al. provide you with a valuable strut to make your case, but instead you feel the need to criticise them for having &#8220;failed to follow through&#8221; with a more thorough examination.

Minor Correction - Line 388 ... (for an example of successful implementation of this strategy..) should read (UNSUCCESSFUL implementation ...)                 The research question is clearly defined, relevant and topical.  A historical case study approach, guided by grounded theory, is used to study the role of leadership and organisational culture in the successful Scottish sea eagle reintroduction project (1975-2012),  The methods essentially consist of interviews along with archival research and the resultant data is both manually and digitally (Nvivo) analysed, all of which conform to standard methods.  There is some confusion in the Methods section (Line 170 on..) in relation to how many people were interviewed, and who were they? The number of interviewees varies from 11, 13, 15, 18 (lines 200-2007).  I believe the actual number was 11 with four follow up interviews.  The interviews form the core of the research and its findings, but a sample size of 11 project employees is very small. I believe we also need more information about who the interviewees are (without naming then), and the role they played in the project,  All we are told is that they were full time employees of the project for at least three months, during any phase of the 37 year project (1975-2012). I suggest that the actual role of all the interviewees, [were they the Directors (Dennis &amp; Love, present throughout the project), administrative or public relations staff, or biologists etc.], should be stated along with when and for how long they worked on the project.  I recommend a table should be added with this information.  Memory recall from a short term employee back in 1975 may not be very reliable!The contribution of this research is in highlighting the importance of leadership and the organisational culture of the reintroduction project (a very valid point), but the author does not formally outline the organisational structure &amp; decision making process of the sea eagle project.  I recommend a flow chart/ section with this information.  I also believe that the 'Interviewee Demographics' (Line 246- 255), should come under the Methods section of the paper, rather than the Results.Finally the 'Interview Summary' section (Line 256-295) from which emerge the four main research findings is very short!          Line 320 - the author needs to explain more fully what 'Champion' style leadership is..                 The paper makes an important and valid point - that species reintroduction is about more than just biology.  The research findings relate to four key themes /recommendations for best practice organisational management in wildlife reintroduction programmes.  The findings are valid, well made and have wider applicability beyond this case study research.  But, as the author states in Line 397, - 'the findings are limited by their exploratory (&amp; therefore preliminary) nature'.  This research is valid but not substantial in nature, essentially due to the limited number of interviews and lack of clarity as to who was interviewed (as discussed above).  It  is exploratory work that requires more substantial research to fully validate its findings.   However,  it still makes a valid, if preliminary, contribution.

In my opinion, the background to the need for this methodology is not appropriately described while there is plenty of vague, un-necessary and out-of-context text scattered around.Some specific comments:1 - In the abstract, the sentence \"&#8230; functional predictions on a single sample (and compare scores for individual samples across multiple groups), and BD-Func can provide predictive statistics and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) &#8230;&#8221; should be written as &#8220;&#8230; functional predictions on a single sample, compare scores for individual samples across multiple groups, and provide predictive statistics and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) &#8230;&#8221;2 &#8211; First sentence on page 2 is vague and does not make strong connection with functional enrichment methods referenced there in. Importantly, there are 25+ citations dumped almost at the start of the paper, which does not seem reasonable. In my opinion, these should be reduced significantly, citing only the most relevant ones and perhaps citing some appropriate review article of such methods, if available.3- Again in page 2, the sentence &#8220;&#8230; in a single sample is a unique feature only present in a limited number of functional genomic tools &#8230;&#8221; How does this stand with the relevant statement made in the abstract (given in (1))?4- Page 6: &#8220;For the Connectivity Map analysis&#8230;. &#8221; Seems like out of place or at least without much connection established with the ongoing section.                 Author use t-statistics and ANOVA output to compare groups of activated and inhibited genes, for enrichment analysis. It might well be, as authors claim, an efficient way of performing enrichment analysis for the case of activated and inhibited genes and it might be useful for the community. My concern is that the research question answered by this methodlogy was poorly defined, and methodology is not well explained at all. It is hard to find significant novelty in the method, at least from the way it is explained in the manuscript. Authors must explain the new method in much more detail and step-wise fashion so that reader can get the sense of it and can appreciate the novelty and application. A lot has been left for the reader to explore. Introduction and Methods sections need to be re-written with much clarity and detail                 Authors compare their approach to two well-known methods, i.e., GSEA and IPA, using signatures from MSigDB and other novel datasets. Overall comparison is good on these limited data sets, but I am unable to make an authentic statement about the wider applicability of the approach. Also, in comparison to existing methods, BD-Func seems to have limited application, i.e., only the cases related to both up and down regulated genes.             Comments:The manuscript needs major revisions in order to be considered for publication. Besides the overall tidying-up of the manuscript, by removing un-necessary text and citations, Introduction and Methods section need major re-write.

Comments:This article describes the enhanced effect of combining WGS information with traditional field epidemiology to inform management of an established KPC producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreak.The text is well written, clear and unambiguous with sufficient relevant references and background provided.General commentsThe value of the WGS in the context of patient benefit and healthcare economics is difficult to quantify and the manuscript would benefit from estimates of these in this study, i.e. the authors state that further transmission has slowed because of increased intervention but is there an estimate of the healthcare saving and patient benefit because of this? This is a subjective area but if screening had been introduced at an earlier stage would there be an estimated saving in terms of hospital bed days for example?The authors discuss the revision of guidelines for outbreak management since the study was performed, a discussion of further improvements/recommendations and how they would be implemented would be of value. Throughout the manuscript the term real-time is used to describe how WGS informed transmission dynamics and subsequent infection control management. Near real-time is more accurate as it still takes at least a week to take appropriate samples, culture, sequence and analyse the information.The ability to determine whom infected whom in these investigations is an interesting point for discussion and also has potentially difficult ethical/legal considerations that could also be discussed.

Scripts used in the analyses have also been made available via two GitHub repos.Human Participant Checks:The investigation was undertaken by a public health agency as part of an outbreak response. No identifying information is included in the article or in the publicly available data.                 The article is well-suited to publication in PeerJ, offering an extremely comprehensive investigation of a pathogen of international concern. The objective of the study is clearly described, and the work presents an exemplary model for uniting genomic and epidemiological investigations of hospital-associated infections. Each of the many analyses was done to high technical standards, and described in enough detail for others to be able to replicate the work.                 The conclusions around the origins and the transmission of the outbreak isolates are well-supported by the data, and clearly linked to downstream infection control activities. Limitations of the study are clearly identified.             Comments:This is wonderfully detailed and fascinating investigation of CPEs circulating in Victoria, Australia over 2012-2015, which links genomic and epidemiological data in a way that very few papers in this domain have. It was a very enjoyable read, and my suggestions for improvement are all very minor and addressing them is left to the author's discretion.Introduction1. The abstract mentions that the genomic epidemiology investigation proved more fruitful than genomics or traditional epidemiology alone. Perhaps towards the end of the Introduction, the authors could describe what the state of the epidemiological understanding was at the time the genomic investigation was launched - were there obvious gaps that the genomic analysis was aimed at closing?Methods1. The authors are to be commended for the incredible breadth and depth of their analyses! That being said, there is definitely a lot for the reader to keep track of here, so perhaps a figure outlining the study workflow could be provided to orient the reader.2. Along those lines, the Bioinformatics subsection contains many analyses - these could be further subdivided into smaller sections to facilitate reading.Results1. Line 310: Would be helpful to briefly differentiate KPC-2 and KPC-3 earlier in the manuscript for the reader unfamiliar with these designations - perhaps a brief comment in the Introduction, including their incidence in other settings like the US.2. Line 311: \"from one patient\" instead of \"from the one patient\"3. Figure 1: The annual peaks in Sept/Oct/Nov are interesting and might merit some comment in the Conclusions section.4. Line 313: delete the \"of\"5. Line 315: For the readers who skip the Intro and Methods and head straight to result, it would be helpful to explain what the \"Initial Analysis\" was - from my reading of the methods, it was a retrospective 2014 look at the isolates from the 29 patients identified to date, with further work happening prospectively.6. Figure 2: Depending on the actual geography, it might be interesting to colour the facility nodes according to their distance from each other, maybe with the most central Melbourne facility as a saturated colour with the other facilities less saturated as one moves out. This would, of course, only be really interesting if there was some spatial structure to the phylogeny, but it is suggested in the Combined Analysis section. It would be interesting to note Facility F, though, which is mentioned later on in the text.7. Figure 4: No suggestions here, just wanted to compliment you on this super figure!8. Line 392: A lot of the TransPhylo transmission events arise from unsampled individuals (white nodes), whereas I imagine the screening in place knowing that KPC was circulating meant that most of the population should have been fully sampled. I think (as a TransPhylo author ;) that this is a bit of a shortcoming of this current implementation &#8211; I think it sometimes overestimates the proportion of unsampled cases. This might be worth commenting on, as would noting whether any of the chains it did identify amongst the sequenced isolates (I spot an interesting one involving five B1-harbouring individuals) were reflected in the epidemiology.9. Line 430: I wonder if a figure summarizing the plasmid content of each isolate might be helpful here, to give a quick visual of which isolates across which species harboured identical or near-identical plasmids.10. Line 475: What sort of accessory genome changes?11. Figure 9: I see environmental sampling isolates in this tree that appear to be closely linked to one of the patients for whom multiple isolates were sequenced (bright pink patient) and another singly-sequenced patient. This is interesting, but I don&#8217;t see a mention of it in the main text.Supplement:1.

This preclinical in vivo study aimed originally to evaluate the curative medication effect of a low or high dose of meloxicam on cartilage and subchondral bone deteriorations in a rodent model of chemically (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis. The aim and the results are interesting but the study is presenting several Basic Reporting failures, namely: -       Objectives and hypothesis are well defined but the relevance of doing a pharmacokinetic study is missing.-       A major lack of rigor in the manner to cite references in the text (there is a lot of heterogeneity, particularly in the introduction section), for ex.: (Dumond et al 2004).

This error is repeated throughout the text. - Methods: Monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) is well known to induce osteoarthritis in stifle of rodent similar to human disease. In this study, the authors often use the term arthritis in combination with osteoarthritis. There is a misunderstood for the authors between these two different pathologies. This mistake is repeated several times in the article. Moreover, the term knee is use to describe a joint in human. In animal, we should use the term stifle. This error is repeated throughout the text. -Results: It lacks all the statistical P values for the reader. *Introduction L52: Please add the abbreviation of osteoarthritis in brackets.

L282: The term arthritis is inappropriate. -The authors do not discuss the PK results obtained and the major limitations concerning this part of the study. -Moreover, meloxicam is well known to produce analgesic effects and pain is omnipresent in osteoarthritis disease. The authors never discuss the possible difference in the degree of pain observed between the four groups of rats during the curative treatment period.                 The aim and the results are interesting but the study is presenting several Methodological failures, namely: - Objectives and hypothesis are well defined but the relevance of doing a pharmacokinetic study is missing.- Experimental design: The additional 4 weeks after treatment cessation at the end is not supported in the methodology or in the discussion, as well as the dose of mososodium iodoacetate injected in the stifle of the rats.- Statistics must be reviewed for cytokines quantification.- Cytokine analysis: Lack of reference for cytokine concentrations from normal rats serum. Injection of saline in control group seems not so neutral, causing inflammation.- The management of pain is not assayed despite the well-known analgesic effect of the drug used.- There are major confusion in the number of animals used for the study. We understand from Figure 1 that 2 animals were excluded, but there is no mention for which reason. Without such information, the exclusion could be associate to data cherry picking.- There is no indication that the treatments administration was blinded.- Blood sampling volume must be indicated every where, when required. This is particularly important for the PK study, as such repeated blood sampling in rats has major ethical regulations. - Most of all, the reviewer has major problem with the method of euthanasia used, namely \"excessive halothane inhalation\". In Canada, the CCAC does no more accept such method of inhaled anesthetics only as humane method of euthanasia, the easons being the stress and the aversion caused to gas exposure, the length before getting euthanasia, and the technical difficulties related to get efficient overdose in a safe environment. As stated by the CCAC \"In general, overdose of an inhalation anesthetic agent is an effective method of euthanasia for many species. However, time to death is quite lengthy, and therefore use of a second procedure to ensure death of the animal is recommended once the animal is unconscious as a result of the anesthetic\", and, in my appreciation, the authors must detail the duration to gas exposure, with concentration of exposure as well as signs assessed by the veterinarian for confirming death.Methodology Figure 1: The benefit to extend the study 4 additional weeks at the end without treatment is not supported. L113: A comma is underlined. L119-128: The osteoarthritis model: The choice to inject 4 mg of MIA in a volume of 50 uL of saline when the reference cited in the introduction (Guzman et al., 2003) used a dose of 2 mg in 50 uL of saline is not justified. Same thing with the other cited reference in the introduction (Dumond et al., 2004) which injected a dose of 0.03 mg of the chemical agent. The references in the introduction are not relevant with the experimental design. Moreover, no references are cited in this part of the methodology supporting MIA dose. L135-139: Meloxicam doses (low and high) have been established on which references? A pilot study have been done before this study in the aim to determine the doses of meloxicam? L141-152: Pharmacokinetic (PK) study of meloxicam: The goal and objective of this part of study are missing. This PK study is not supported before in the introduction and not discussed later. How the timepoints for blood collection have been defined? Are they optimal for a PK study using meloxicam in male rats? Why only the high dose have been modeling? Which PK model have you used to determine the parameters of meloxicam? The results shown in L153-154 concerning the PK study should not be found in this part of the article.  L196-206: Statistical analysis: For your personal information, you don&#8217;t need to verify the normal distribution for ordinal values like as histological score. Have you tried to manipulate cytokine data (for example in semi-logarithmic, logarithmic or exponential transformation) in order to get a normal distribution?                 A major critic is related to the semi-quantitative score for determining COX-2 reactivity:A semi-quantitative scoring system was applied: score 0, no reaction; score 1, faint reaction, 1-5% of cells positive; score 2, 6-25% of the cells positive; score 3, 26-50% of the cells positive; score 4, &gt;50% of the cells (chondrocytes in cartilage/fibroblasts, fibrocytes in subchondral bone, and hematopoietic elements in bone marrow) positive.As the range of values presented in Table 3 is from 0 to 3, such classification induces a potential bias toward the Placebo group which would have presented 6% of positive cells to get a score of 2, whereas the Meloxicam groups would get 5% and getting a score of 1. It would have been a better approach to compare the percentage of positive cells between groups.  ResultsL234: Inter-groups significant difference? Table 1: The fail to demonstrate some difference in cytokine concentrations between the four groups seem to be related with the fact that the injection of saline appears to be not so neutral, causing some inflammation.

Line 53 -57: Suggests that the role of subchondral bone in the pathogenesis of OA is a recent finding, however it has been argued for decades that subchondral bone may drive disease onset and/ or progression. In particular, increased cytokine production by osteoblasts in OA was reported as early as 1997 and 1998 by Westacott and Hilal, respectively. This should be reflected in the text and references, along with the more recent discoveries by Berenbaum, Yu and Yuan.Line 61-68: The authors describe the histological changes of MIA-induced OA by Guzman, however it would be useful to include more information on the timing of disease progression, so that the reader understands why treatments were administered at the time points chosen in this study. It is explained in the discussion but this needs to be made clearer in the introduction, along with a clearer explanation of study design in general.Introduction shows context, but the aim of the study is not clearly stated. Furthermore, argumentation concerning the reason that this model represents chronic OA and the used dosage Meloxicam is lacking. The paragraph which describes the histological grading systems (88-95) is too extensive and outside the context.The structure conforms with the PeerJ standard. Figures are relevant and high quality, however some changes are needed (see below).Figure 2 legend needs to be simplified.  The descriptions of histological findings are long and repeated in the results section. A scale bar and uniform orientation of images (with cartilage surface at the top) would aid interpretation of results by the reader.Figure 4: Re-order images so that they are in keeping with Table 2. As with figure 2, include a scale bar and same orientation.Raw data is supplied.

The comparison between low- and high-dosage Meloxicam is mentioned in the abstract, but the research question is lacking in the introduction. It could be more emphasized how this research fills an identified knowledge gap.Rigorous investigation performed to a high technical and ethical standard.Methods described with sufficient detail and information to replicate in general. Exceptions are: -The sample size calculation: it is not clear which means are used.  -The presence of OA confirmed by radiography: the grading system used needs to be stated in the methods section along with the introduction.A key finding of this paper is the reduction in subchondral bone lesions with high-dose meloxicam treatment, and that subchondral bone expression of Cox-2 is shown to be reduced with both high and low-dose meloxicam, compared with the placebo. The authors suggest in the discussion that local low-grade inflammation was highlighted through Cox-2 expression and subsequently suppressed by meloxicam- which is a Cox-2 specific inhibitor. More evidence is needed to demonstrate subchondral bone inflammation and its suppression by meloxicam, such as histological scoring of inflammatory features (infiltrating cells) and/ or immunohistochemical staining for inflammatory cytokines and CD markers.                 Validity of the findingsData is robust, statistically sound and controlled. The results in the paragraph named &#8220;characteristic joint lesions of the groups&#8217; is hard to follow. The reader should be directed to the Figure panel at the beginning of the paragraph so that descriptions and comparisons between example images can be followed.The discussion seemed to be an overview about different aspects of e.g. (MIA-induced) OA models, Meloxicam, and systemic inflammation, each of them represented in a separate paragraph. There is no logical flow and what is stated is not well connected to the findings of this paper.

Menon et al. selected SNPs shared with at least 2 programs, and showed that the method facilitates detection of reliable SNPs, not including false-positives.Although, to detect SNPs, they used Bos taurus genome assembly as the reference sequence, detection of species and breeds specific SNPs was avoided by selecting high-milk yield specific or low-milk yield specific SNPs.Furthermore, they considered that genes locating the high-yield specific or low-yield specific SNPs were candidate genes for milk-yield, and they showed that the candidate genes included many of known milk-yield and fat QTL candidate genes.

Especially the second part could represent substantial contribution to the respective field. Research questions are properly defined, data collected in the field survey correctly analysed and presented using suitable diagrams and tables. However, the interpretation of the results lacks the view of plant ecologist and discussion of the findings is sometimes rather vague (see specific points below). Biology of hemiparasitic Castilleja plants was not well introduced and also acknowledged when planning field sampling design for this study. Comparison of adjacent plots with and without hemiparasites (from visual estimates of Castilleja presence in the year of survey) does not enable to make strong inference about effect of this functional group on plant community functioning. This would need experimental manipulation (either introduction or removal of Castilleja) and more years of plot monitoring.Major study caveats:1) Samples of roots selected for evaluation of mycorrhizal status (lines 123 &#8211; 140) were not checked for the connection of haustoria from Castilleja plants. Thus, this study does not bring a direct test whether hemiparasites decrease colonisation of host roots by mycorrhiza.2) According to methodology (lines 118 &#8211; 119) the dominant plant species for evaluation of the mycorrhizal status should be the species with &#8216;the highest relative abundance across 20 plots recorded at each site&#8217;. However, having the raw plant community data in hand this rule was respected by the authors only at one site &#8211; i.e. with the lowest elevation (2480m, Balsamorhiza sagittata) but not in other 4 sites. Correctly should be used following species: 2740m (Phlox hoodii with 37% relative abundance instead of Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus with 22%); 3200m (Helianthella quinquenervis with 11% instead of Viola adunca with 9%); 3392 m (Potentilla gracilis with 16% instead of Ligusticum porter with 15%) and 3460m (Poa alpina with 17% instead of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi with 7%).3) Missing raw mycorrhizal data in the Excel sheet (showing only 98, missing 2 from 3200m site).Minor points to be solved:Lines 44 &#8211; 47: Hemiparasitic plants can reduce the abundance of dominant plant species, but this feature is rather limited to &#8216;root hemiparasites&#8217; (not stem).Lines 52 &#8211; 54: It needs to be emphasized that hemiparasites from definition (hemi) are dependent on host in the case of water and dissolved mineral nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg  etc.) but carbon received from parasitism is of minor importance for them. Hemiparasites are green plants and do photosynthesis and carbon assimilation on their own (in contrast to holoparasites).Lines 54 &#8211; 55: Indeed &#8216;hemiparasites may compete with host plant plants for soil resources through absorptive roots&#8217; but this is not &#8216;additionally&#8217; to above mentioned &#8216;haustoria&#8217; (line 53).

", "There are quite a few minor errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation throughout.  The literature cited does not always back up or refer to the points made in the article, and this was particularly common in the introduction. The sections on fungi and climate definitely need to be improved as they do not make the best use of the literature.  The article is structured well but the figure and table legends need to be clearer so that the reader can interpret them without referring to the main text.I applaud the authors for making their raw data available along with their R-code.  This really useful.I have made specific line by line comments in the general comments section below, which will hopefully assist the authors.                 The design appears to be mostly sound, although a figure of the actual layout would be really helpful (randomised but adjacent sampling could be more clearly expressed in a  figure).  The root sampling is not convincing from the point of view of only collecting the target species.  I think the authors need to acknowledge that they cannot be certain that the roots examined come from the target plant alone.Research questions were well defined, relvant, and meaningful.Technical and ethical standards are high, but choice of statistical analyses is incorrect in places.Replication of the methods will be possible once the randomised adjactent sampling is better explained.                 The main issue with the article is the use of simple linear models to assess data that includes binary variables and species counts.  GLM or mixed model approaches are needed, and it would be useful to note whether the distribution and variance of the data was examined.  The use of ordination techniques could also be improved and further explored by exploring the correct number of dimensions for NMDS and applying MRPP or PerMANOVA approaches.  Once the authors have revised their analyses to use the correct techniques then it will be easier to assess the validity of the findings.             Comments:In general I think there is a really good paper in here that just needs some more thought and careful re-examination of the data with the correct statistical techniques.  The study system is really interesting and the results of the study will be of interest to readers in a few different fields of ecology.Specific commentsIntroduction, ln 48: abundance, not abundantLn 53: haustoria, not haustroriaLn 56: remove commaLns 54-58: This sentence is a bit unclear and needs to be more specific. Is the suggestion here that the hemiparasites may form mycorrhizas with AMF that compete with the AMF of the host plant for resources? Or do you mean that the hemiparasites associate with the same AMF as the host plant (e.g. via a common mycorrhizal network) and reduce the quantity of nutrients being transferred to the primary host? How would DSEs help a hemiparasite to compete for soil resources? It would be appropriate to provide a reference for this, although I&#8217;m not aware of any evidence for DSEs providing competitive benefits to hemiparasites (Li and Guan record colonisation in their 2007 paper but I don&#8217;t they studied impacts on competition). Lns 59-60: The Joshi et al 2000 paper does not measure belowground biomass or even discuss fungi. Here you are speculating that AMF and DSE may have an additional effect beyond what has been investigated in the literature, but this sentence reads as though it has been previously explored and is an accepted idea.Lns 60-62: That is a strong statement to make about DSEs. The Mandyam &amp; Jumpponen paper you cite makes the point that responses to DSEs are hugely variable.  I don&#8217;t recall there being any evidence of nutrient uptake by DSEs, so you might want to clarify whether you mean growth benefits or something else.Ln 62-63: Should be (Stewart and Press, 1990).  This reference does not make that claim. Your statement is one possible hypothesis that can be drawn from the paper, but they certainly don&#8217;t test it or even mention it.  It could also be that hemiparasite colonisation has no effect on the carbon allocated to fungal symbionts, or perhaps the plant allocates more carbon to the symbionts in an effort to increase its access to nutrients.Ln 63-66: This is better.  It would be useful to note that this has been shown in controlled pot experiments. Ln 67: The Stewart and Press reference does not mention this concept.Ln 69-70: Choice of references is a bit odd again, but maybe it is just the sentence structure.  If you start out by noting that climate contexts shape fungal and plant community structure and function (there are lots of more recent papers on the impacts of climate on plant and fungal communities), you can then say that hemiparasites are likely to interact with these effects.Ln 70-71: So do beneficial mutualistic interactions. I think you could strengthen this section (lns 69-79) through better choice of references and more careful wording. Section starting Lns 73-79 is good, but 69-73 is weak (including a sentence that cites the same two papers twice).Ln 91: Point 2) does not flow properly in the context of a list beginning with &#8220;We hypothesised that:&#8221; You could change it to 2) the presence of Castilleja would alter community composition.Methods, ln 104: You have a superscript 1 after cm.Ln 113-114: Can you put in a figure to illustrate this? I&#8217;m curious about how this was done in practice as 20 plots per elevation is easy to understand, but randomly selected adjacent plots with and without Castilleja is not so clear.  There is the potential for spatial autocorrelation in your sampling so it would be useful to give the reader more information.Lns 123-140: So this is just a bulk root sample, you didn&#8217;t try to identify whether the roots came from one or multiple host plants / host plant species?Ln 144: plant species richnessLn 145-149: This is problematic. You do not indicate having examined the distribution or variance of the data, and one of your variables is binary (present/absence). Really you should be using a glm (Generalised linear model) or LME (linear mixed effect model) function not a simple linear model.  This will allow you to account for a binomial error structure by including a logit link function or a poisson error structure using a log link function (plant species richness is count data).  You should also include some species accumulation curves (could be supplemental) for your plant community data to show whether you reached saturation or not. Ln 158-164: Using NMDS you could include all of the elevations together to see if they differ from each other.  You would also want to use an MRPP or PerMANOVA analysis to examine whether + and &#8211; Castilleja groups are considered significantly different or not.  The problem with using R to do NMDS is that you are telling it to look at two axes without knowing how many axes best explain the data.  I&#8217;m not sure if there is a workaround because I do not use R for doing ordinations.  It may be that a 3D fit is best, which could change things substantially.Ln 165-170: Same problem as lns 145-149 above, you cannot use a linear model to examine a binary predictor in this way. You also need to adjust the language to note that the roots are not necessarily just from the dominant host.Results will all need to be re-assessed following analysis with correct models. Subheadings should reflect the hypotheses being tested, rather than the interpretation of the results.Discussion will also need to be reassessed following corrected analyses.ln 216: low abundance, not low abundant. Should be a full stop after diversity, a comma after however, and insert &#8220;the presence of these plants&#8221; or something similar.Ln 234-236: From the way the methods are written you cannot be sure that those roots all came from the dominant host, so be careful with the statements about what you can show here.References ln 398: the link is brokenFigure 1. Define what you mean by plant community.  Legend details are a bit sparse. The reader should have all of the information they need in the figure legend.Figure 2. How many ordination axes did you examine?  If you have three significant axes then those communities could be separated in ordination space.

The data and analyses are robust, but the interpretation is not fully supported by the results, especially since the causality is unclear in observational study. See detailed comments below.             Comments:Review on manuscript 28743Hemiparasitic plants increase alpine plant diversity but reduce arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization in dominant plant speciesSubmitted to PeerJRecommendation: Major revisionThe study reported in this manuscript aimed to explore the effect of a hemiparasitic plant genus on plant species diversity, composition and root fungal colonization in an altitudinal gradient. The research questions are well supported by the introduction, the sampling was well designed and data processed by appropriate methods. The authors are native speakers, unlike me, and the manuscript was easily intelligible to me. The study is generally good to be published in PeerJ, but it needs a revision of certain points. Especially, I am very doubtful about the interpretation of the observed patterns as causal relationships, and I find the selection of diversity measures misleading. In addition, I have many minor comments, which need the authors&#8217; attention.Comments to the authors:Throughout the whole manuscript, you state that &#8220;presence of Castilleja impacted / increased / reduced... something&#8221;. However, this is an observational study and you have no evidence that the observed statistical relationships are caused by the parasitic behaviour of Castilleja. For instance, a related hemiparasitic plant Rhinanthus minor is also known to reduce community biomass and sporadically increase plant richness, but at the same time it fails to establish in more productive and less diverse communities, and it is impossible to disentangle these two processes without a manipulative experiment. Your study provides valuable data, but the observed patterns must be interpreted appropriately, e.g. &#8220;presence of Castilleja was associated with higher species richness...&#8221;.Hejcman, M., Schellberg, J., Pavl&#367;, V., 2011.

Richness and evenness are independent of each other, but both diversity measures are just composed of richness and evenness in various proportion. Therefore the p-values for the diversity measures are in between the ones of richness and evenness, and Simpson is less significant than Shannon. Statements like &#8220;Castilleja increased plant species richness and diversity&#8221; (e.g. lines 31 &#8211; 32, 209 &#8211; 210) seem to present two effects, but it is actually just one.

In addition, the row &#8220;Castilleja sp. present&#8221; does not fit to the raw plant community data.

I found the description of model parameters to be extremely lacking and it took several reads to sort things out.  The first three paragraphs of discussion do not touch on your results in any sense.  I found this odd as it should be the showcase.  Not some long discussion that really reads like an introduction.  I want to know what it is you found that should captivate me as a reader, and then get into the literature supporting it.  Structurally I was searching for the point until I hit paragraph four when you actually start talking about what your model performance.In my mind this is a Gerritsen-Strickler encounter probability model and the diver speed is just confounding within the area sampled issue.  The way point samplers deal with this is by using habitat based designs and ramping up sample to collect increase information over area. I think this needs to be dealt with in paragraph one of your discussion.  It&#8217;s the main point of your results and to me it&#8217;s pretty clear in your results. The explanation of the model results in the discussion really needs to be rethought and reorganized because it doesn&#8217;t flow as written and I struggled making sense of what you believe were the most important outcomes.                 The fundamental design is fine.  The execution of describing the model is lacking.  For instance there are few biological or mathematical descriptions of fish traits.  What does diver avoidance = 10 actually mean?  I have no idea, is this a function of some kind?  I can&#8217;t decipher how this manifests in behavior in the model?  What is patch gathering?  What is centre?  You describe some pretty common &#8216;behaviors&#8217; such as schooling or cryptic but you don&#8217;t actually tell the reader how that is modeled.  For instance schools really act as a single individual in space, but from what I could tell you&#8217;re modeling individuals to simulate a density of 0.3 per meter.  Are you simply distributing the school spatially?  Do they aggregate in the model?  Schools by definition are extremely patchy because all the individuals occur in one sighting.  At one point you state that abundance apparently does not affect bias.  Yet when I think about counting a school of a thousand fish as a diver, with no permanent record, all I can think of is bias.  Memory in the sense of what you modeled should dramatically reduce the ability of a diver to detect &#8216;individuals&#8217; in a school and bias these counts severely.  Yet I don&#8217;t understand how that&#8217;s handled because don&#8217;t know how individuals in schools move relative to one another, how they&#8217;re actually spatially distributed on your grid, and how that might manifest itself in &#8216;counting and density errors&#8217; in your model.  Units are difficult to sort out relative to time-step, fish movement speed, cell size, and count-memory.  I have no idea how the perception distance, perception angles etc are actually used in the model to understand how those may impact model results (i.e. fish response to vehicle is not really described other than to say that you have some parameters).  This all needs better description, not just redirection to another paper or effort somewhere else.  It&#8217;s not the readers job to hunt down supporting arguments if those can&#8217;t be easily explained within the context of a stand-alone effort.                 I don&#8217;t really understand the estimation of density on the point count census.  I understand it from a transect point of view because its distance.  However you state the for the point count, the thing is rotating, but do not describe if the swept area of that cube is additive or static?  More importantly, in either sampling case, time is confounded with area and speed.  You don&#8217;t really address this in a straight forward way.  Think about the stationary point count, as an extremely slow vehicle in which area basically doesn&#8217;t change and yet survey time is increased incrementally.  Thus encounter probability in the volume is increasing, yet area/volume is static.  Nobody in their right mind should be deriving densities in this manner from empirical data, specifically for highly mobile species.  You&#8217;ve got that correct in here.  Now think about the moving diver case.  When you increase speed and decrease distance all you&#8217;ve really done is decrease encounter probability.  Vice versa, decrease speed and increase transect length, you&#8217;ve increased encounter probability.  Hence time is confounded within the transect information.  Whereas you explicitly deal with it on the point count.  In my mind this is a Gerritsen-Strickler encounter probability model and the diver speed issue is confounded with the area issue.  The way point samplers deal with this is by using habitat based designs and ramping up sample (i.e. get data over more area).  I think this needs to be dealt with in paragraph one of your discussion.  It&#8217;s the main point of your results and its pretty clear in your results (heat plots).Line 253.  I think this is critical and needs to be in the results or somehow highlighted.  Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s enough to just call it bias.  I like the heat plots, but maybe you can incorporate color to determine positive/negative bias results?  Or 3 dimensional.Line 254-255.  Maybe that&#8217;s the case in the literature but I would not have assumed that these were overestimates at all, particularly in the case of mobile schooling species with strong &#8216;boldness&#8217; factors.Line 285-287.  No idea what this actually means.Line 301.  You approach the detection probability relative to movement of the sampler/diver (i.e. non-instantaneous sampling) but don&#8217;t put it into a single package.  A stationary point count, is just a really slowly executed transect.  The more you increase time, the higher the encounter probability gets and the worse the estimate.  Transects are just confounded with speed and distance.Line 307-308.  Fits with just what I said, but in this case you increase the area and thus relieved some of the assumptions about encounter probability all of which is confounded by the fish movement.All of this doesn&#8217;t really deal with attraction and avoidance, where there is active &#8216;seeking&#8217; behavior where divers are trailed or avoided.  It&#8217;s sort of dealt with as shy or bold in approach distance, but that doesn&#8217;t really describe the behavior of fishes that follow (e.g. barracudas).             Comments:I definitely believe this is an effective model and deserving of publication but not in it's current state.  Model description needs to be sorted out so that the interactions dealt with above can be sorted out by the reader.  Otherwise it's sort of a mixed bag of things that take a lot of effort by the reader to understand the point.                                                ", "The introduction was very clear and laid out the problem with designing surveys for reef fish very well. The literature appeared relevant. The structure of the paper followed normal patterns. I may have missed it, but there didn&#8217;t appear to be any raw data provided? The model parameters for the simulations are provided. The tables were informative and followed from the text. A couple of comments on the figure.1)\tThe manuscript would be improved by showing some of the relationships in graphical form that are observed in the S1 and S2 tables. Patterns in relationships among variables using the raw simulation results would be nice to see here. I suggest adding some multi-panel figures that show some of the interesting results from the bias analyses, at least as additional supplementary material. 2)\tThe lone figure is difficult to interpret. I would recommend splitting this figure by species type and showing the results for each type in a single figure (with CV and bias). This would greatly simplify the information and make it easier to follow the patterns being described in the results.3)\tCould the authors present an additional table with the recommended (based on the simulation) sample design and the most attainable values for bias and CV? The current Table 4 is interesting in that the values for bias and precision on average are quite high when combined and likely none of them (on average) would be a sutiable level of bias or CV. It would be more informative to present the best version of survey design and the likely bias and CV.                 The research seems appropriate for PeerJ. The research question is well defined and survey design for underwater visual surveys is has a number of knowledge gaps for which this simulation provides a nice tool to examine. The experimental design seems appropriate for the simulations, the authors do a nice job of presenting information in to back their choice of species groups/parameter combinations. Two main comments here1)\tIt is not quite clear where the choice of density of fish was derived from. Also, I couldn&#8217;t tell if this was the overall density of fishes across all 4 groups or whether this was the density of each fish group.2)\tThere could be few more details provided on the mechanics of the simulation model. For example, the reader has to refer to the original contribution to understand where the stochasticity in the simulation came from.                 The simulations presented in this manuscript appear to be robust and represent the natural variability in conditions the authors have observed in reef fish. As the authors recognize in the discussion, the specific results of this simulation are relevant to the characteristics of the fishes they have specified parameters for. The value of this paper is to demonstrate how the simulation model can be used to explore other types of fishes with other characteristics. As such it is novel, but the more novel contribution would be in the original paper that set out the simulation (i.e. Pais and Cabral 2017). It also seems that a fair amount of work has been done previously on these questions, but the previous results are well integrated into this manauscript. The conclusions that the authors reach appear logical given the data and simulations presented and the data seem robust and statistically sound.             Comments:I enjoyed reading this paper, it was an interesting look at a simulation model for an important survey question and the methods here could be applied elsewhere.1)\tThe abstract is a bit confusing to the reader that has not read the paper. It was not initially clear to me what &#8220;bold&#8221; and &#8220;sly&#8221; fish were or what a &#8220;slow swim&#8221; referred to. Probably because I was not aware the authors were talking about diver surveys until reading the introduction (as there are other types of underwater visual surveys). I would suggest defining this in the abstract, as well as some of the other terminology that appears in the abstract, such as by saying &#8220;bold fish (fish attracted to divers)&#8221;. 2)\tIt was interesting that a single density was chosen for all the simulations. It would seem from other studies of this type that the true density has a large effect on CV and potentially bias (for rarer species). Also, some of these species groups are likely to have very different underlying densities on reefs. For example, pelagic schoolers might be an order of magnitude more dense than cryptic species. I would be interested to hear a bit more about justification of this number across the different species groups.

I noticed that even if volunteers visited all 5 sites every year you do not have information of the 5 sites every year this is a strong limitation of your work as it is. Figures:Figure1: Small square map of the Iberian Peninsula should be noted as panel A. The scale of the small map is not included. You should explicitly explain that the small grey rectangle correspond with the study area. Panel A should be panel B and panel B should be panel C. Figure would not be readable when printed in black and white and is not readable for colour blind people. Figure caption is misleading. If panel A refers to average proportion of birds sighted for each one of the 4 years at each one of the 5 locations, shouldn&#180;t you plot one pie chart by year in each location? At the end of the caption you refer to the number of marked individuals detected at each site, is this a total?

Model selection procedures are not explained in the manuscript please do. See my previous comments on model selection. Notice that you stated abbreviations for some of your covariates (Tarsus, T; Bill length, B and so on). Maybe the model selection table would be more easily readable if you use the same notation.                 They clearly identify the research question and why it is meaningful. In my opinion the used methodology does not allow to draw they conclusions they reached. Their overall result is that despite they find differences between sexes those differences are small and easily negligible. Their results are in accordance with previous studies as they suggest in the main text. Yet probability of dispersal is calculated by GLMM analyses which do not account for recapture probability instead of using a capture-recapture modelling framework. In my opinion this article would be much more robust if they estimated probability of movement from a capture-recapture modelling perspective. In the main text they state that the roosting sites located outside the estuary were less likely to have been monitored therefore probability of recapture there is lower.  In fact, data from Caparica is only available for 2 of the 4 years. No recaptures from Oeiras are available, this could be a consequence of lower use of this roosting site or a result of sampling asymmetry.    Since they do not provide clear information about the amount of recaptures that you have for each of the sites by year therefore is hard to know if they will be able to perform such analyses. I believe the data and the analyses they provided in terms of dispersal probability are not sound enough to draw their final conclusion.  Authors use SFI with which methodology I&#180;m not familiarized therefore I&#8217;m not sure if my comments about it would be very useful. Besides the fact that I would like see this data analysed from a capture-recapture perspective, the methods section lacks explanation of the model selection procedures. You might find useful Burnham and Anderson (2002) book. The discussion section could use some extra work. I noticed that until line 328 the authors suggest that limited movement between wintering areas might result in decreased ability to adapt to changing conditions. Yet from line 329 they present a series of unpublished data that suggest 1) That sanderlings are actually able to move longer distances than the ones reported in the article, and 2) to respond to very concrete spatial-temporal changes. I found this late part of the discussion rather confusing. Moreover, I might have missed it but I think you do not discuss why there is no resight in Oeiras ( notice that it is more or less to the same distance to Samouco than Caparica to Alcochete). Moreover:Tittle states: Influence of age and sex on winter site fidelity of sanderlings Calidris alba. However, in your results and especially in your discussion session you emphasize that there is no influence of age and sex on winter site fidelity. I suggest you to rephrase your title accordingly. Abstract: The abstract includes methodological details (such as the sexing procedure)  that could be removed ( in fact authors moved this part from the main text to the appendix).

Also, what was the weight of mice at the time/day of measuring blood pressure? In the western blot result: 1. There is no loading control in figure 2, although author explained that common control proteins like &#946;-actin and GAPDH are absent from renal microsomes, Ponceau staining of blot can be used instead for the same. 2. Without quantification of western blot signal, it is difficult to conclude anything from the data. Quantification of blot signal is required for comparison and can be done by freely available NIH ImageJ software. 3.

However, a high-salt diet significantly increased blood pressure among CYP2C11-null rats compared with a normal diet. The increase in CYP2C11-null females was significantly higher than in CYP2C11-null males and WT females\". Can authors  describe/speculate the reason for this variability ? (2). Figure 2, under high-salt diet, renal CYP2J2 expression increased both in male and female CYP2C11-null rats compared with WT rats. Authors suggest no significant effect on CYP4A renal expression, however in CYP4A lanes, I can see two very undifferentiated bands both in male and female samples and these bands intensity increased under high-salt condition. My concerns are following : a) Authors should show loading control for each sample (b) Quantify the data by normalizing to loading control (c) Gel should be run longer to see whether there is single or two bands for CYP4A. These could be two isoforms of  CYP4A. After quantifying data, authors can reach to conclusion that there is no change in CYP4A level under high salt condition. (d) What about the protein expression for CYP2C23 and CYP2C24 ?  (3).  In figure 3, authors suggest that after knocking out the CTP2C11 gene, renal CYP2C23 and CYP2C24 mRNA did not differ between CYP2C11-null and WT rats and diet had no effect on mRNA expression. However, I observed that authors have different scales for y-axis in each sample, hence it is difficult to compare the expression level by looking at current graphs. By looking at data in current graphs, I see that expression level of CYP2C23 is lower under high salt diet whereas expression level of CYP2C24 is high in both null mutants.  To make right conclusion about the expression level and significance change, authors should have similar Y-axes and show the mean value/or other parameter for each sample.  How the mRNA levels correlate for CYP4A and CYP2J2?(4). It is difficult to follow the variability in figure 4. Authors should add arrows to indicate variability and also add description in the figure legend.

There are several grammar flaws through the text and I would recommend to share the manuscript with colleagues and take note of the recommendations done here and probably from the other reviewers. Most concerning is the light use of adjectives which are merely anecdotal and most times do not show values or data support (most diverse, significant proportions, dominated, abundant component, much lower, etc.), please take note of this flaw and correct it.

Comments:Major comments:This manuscript was very challenging to review for 2 main reasons: (i) I am unsure if these many metagenomes are comparable quantitatively, and (ii) there are no statistical analyses performed to describe trends or comparisons reported in this manuscript.  These issues are of critical importance, as the authors describe their results in the context of &#8220;higher&#8221;, &#8220;clustering&#8221;, &#8220;increased&#8221;, etc., yet there are no statistical analyses conducted to evaluate these observed results.  I am wondering if the statistical analyses were not performed because the various datasets are not able to be compared *quantitatively* due to differences in metagenome generation methods (it is indicated in the manuscript that this is perhaps the case; i.e., differing read lengths between metagenomes).  If that is the case, then the results comparing the metagenomes (most of the manuscript) are in question and the manuscript should be re-written as a *qualitative* analysis.  If the authors feel that they can *quantitatively* compare these metagenomic results, then there needs to be an inclusion of statistical analyses to evaluate every statement where comparisons are made (i.e., &#8220;higher&#8221;, &#8220;clustering&#8221;, &#8220;increased&#8221;, etc.).  To properly evaluate this manuscript, and the conclusions presented in the Abstract, I need to know whether this is a quantitative-based study, and if so, I need to see statistical analyses conducted to validate the authors&#8217; statements.  Because of these issues, I stopped reviewing the manuscript at Line 367, as I knew I could not evaluate the study as it is presently written and presented.  To be clear, I feel that this study could be interesting and reveal important information; I just cannot review it accurately in its present form. Minor Comments (please note that I stopped reviewing the manuscript at line 367):Line 128: The methods section is very complex with many different bioinformatic tools used for different comparisons.  I found myself drawing a diagram to keep track of all of the steps used to generate the results.  Could the authors include such a diagram as a supplementary figure that will help the reader understand the overall process? (i.e., a flowchart showing the steps of data analysis and the resulting datasets that were used to interpret the data).Lines 140-141: Upon initial reading, it seemed as though the authors had not stated the methods used to assemble the metagenomes.  These methods are stated later in the manuscript (lines 223-224).  I suggest either inserting a &#8220;see methods below&#8221; phrase, or removing this statement about assemblies from the paragraph since the paragraph is in regards to what metagenomes were used and where they came from.Line 143: In this paragraph, please specify that the authors are examining microbial metagenomes (I assume these are not the viral metagenomes).  Also it would be good to mention whether all of the microbial metagenomes were generated with the same methods (i.e., same prefilter size?, same sequencing platform, read length, and depth of sequencing?).  This information will help the reader understand how comparable these diverse metagenomes are &#8211; please discuss this a bit as well for the readers&#8217; benefit.Lines 213-217: Is there a reference for this method?  If so, please include it.  If this is a method developed by the authors, please include information validating that it is accurate.Lines 251-263: This discussion of prior results seems to belong in the Discussion section, as it seems to not include any results from the present study.Line 267: I do not think the term &#8220;diverse&#8221; should be used here, as a diversity metric was not calculated. Further, the data presented in Fig 1A includes several different levels of taxonomy (i.e., phylum, order, etc.), and includes an &#8220;other&#8221; category; as such, it is difficult to gauge a diversity level from just looking at the graph.  The authors should either calculate a diversity metric, or use a more appropriate description of the data (i.e., number of OTUs).Lines 278-281: Please use a statistical analysis to evaluate the clustering of these samples in the PCA plot (i.e., are these clusters statistically significant?).  For example, this can be done using factors in the program R.Lines 300-304: This information also seems to belong in the Discussion section.Lines 305-316: These trends with salinity need to be evaluated statistically (i.e., is there a significant trend with salinity? Are these values significantly different between salterns?).  Figure 2: Please indicate the units for the y-axis. Please also define the abbreviations for each gene for ease of reading this figure.Figure 3: Please indicate the units for colors on the heatmaps.Lines 320-341: It is difficult to determine whether the described &#8220;clustering&#8221; is significant or not.

"], "10.7717/peerj.620": ["This article addresses an important and timely topic, that of applying DNA sequencing and phylogenetic inference to characterize ongoing outbreaks of bacterial pathogens. In general the writing is clear although I felt that the structure of the article could be improved by shifting the methods section to precede the results. This is a methods-focused article and understanding of the results is simply not possible without having first read the methods (although some of the more technical details in the methods are not required to understand results). Several of the figures would benefit from improvement in order to communicate information more effectively and I have made some specific suggestions about that below.                 An attempt has been made to evaluate several different strategies for the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial genomes. The authors have collected a very nice dataset where the same isolates have been sequenced on different high throughput sequencing platforms, then analyzed using a variety of different approaches. Unfortunately there is a major weakness with this approach to comparing sequencing platforms, which is that the true evolutionary history is unknown, so it is impossible to know how accurately any particular phylogenetic reconstruction reflects the truth. The authors acknowledge this issue and instead focus on comparing approaches to see which produces the most consistent results from run to run. This is measuring variance in the methods and not accuracy and it is absolutely critical that the article be revised to make the distinction clear.Part of the analysis focuses on the ability of various approaches to distinguish a collection of outbreak-associated isolates from other isolates. There is an implicit assumption that the outbreak strains are truly monophyletic. I am not very familiar with that particular dataset and it would help readers like me if the basis for this assumption were explained, for example if there are additional lines of evidence apart from sequence data that support the assertion such as spatial or temporal data. In particular it would be helpful to understand why it's impossible for a non-outbreak isolate in the dataset to share ancestry with the outbreak strains.Another major issue that must be addressed more directly in the manuscript is how uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstructions was dealt with. When an inference program produces a topology that conflicts with the expected topology are incompatible splits included with high support values? gsi apparently has the ability to account for uncertainty by processing bootstrap replicates, and it may be possible to employ a similar approach with the other topological distance metrics.                 It is not clear that all of the claims made in the discussion and conclusion section are supported by the data. In particular, more information is required on how support values (whether they are SH-like or bootstrap supports or something else) relate to the apparent topological discordance. I have highlighted a few specific places where more data is required to substantiate claims in my comments below.             Comments:I have a number of specific comments that I have listed below.Fig 2C, log scale would help -- Fig 2, This plot is misleading because it suggests that the HiSeq variation is very low, but this is just because there is a single sample while the other platforms have many! The data needs to be presented in a way that communicates both number of samples and the variance in the distribution.Why bother including the HiSeq data at all? With only a single sample there is essentially no statistical power to say anything meaningful about how this platform compares to the others.Line 104, what metric is being used to calculate the pairwise differences presented in Figure 3? I think it is described later in methods but it would help to mention where to find the metric.Line 105, what about replicate runs on the HiSeq?From Fig 3 it looks like SolSNP and bcftools might be calling the same differences because their patterns are similar, but it is difficult to know with any certainty. It would be interesting to know if the variation among replicates is driven predominantly by variation in the sequence data rather than the algorithm. one way to assess this would be to take all the pairwise differences between all runs (e.g. bcftools vs. bcftools, SolSNP vs. bcftools, SolSNP vs. SolSNP, not sure if kSNP can be included) and apply some type of dimensionality reduction (MDS, PCA, etc) to determine if most of the variation corresponds to differences among replicates rather than differences among SNP callersLine 122: \"Our results indicate that a matrix that accepts some level of missing data, while not including all possibilities is optimal for phylogenetic inference\" this is a conclusion, but the data which leads us to this conclusion has not yet been presented!Line 129: \"Although some of these additional SNPs may be due to mobile elements, it is also likely that many of them are erroneous, which may explain the decrease in bootstrap support despite the larger matrix when compared to the de novo majority matrix\" I don't understand what leads the authors to this conclusion. What evidence exists that these are erroneous rather than a product of recombination among strains? The loss of bootstrap support values when the matrix includes increasing levels of missing data is a common phenomenon I believe, and derives from the fact that bootstrap sampling of a matrix with a high fraction of missing values tends to include few of the sites with complete information, causing tree inference on that replicate to be poorly informed.Figure 6: Many of the nodes overlap each other and this often obscures high or low confidence nodes. This makes it hard to read the figure. One way to resolve the issue would be to use alpha channel blending (e.g. translucency) when plotting the cladogram.Figure 7 &amp; 8: what are the branch lengths? if possible their meaning should be described. Also, it looks like the topologies sorted according to some branching order metric, however this causes the tanglegrams to look a lot more tangled than they might be if the topologies were sorted to minimize crossing lines in the tanglegram. It makes the degree of topological discordance very difficult to discern in the figure. Fig 9: in its current form this figure is not as helpful as it could be. There appear to be subtle differences among the trees but this is really hard to see when the collection of 8 divergent strains are included.Line 155: \"...we are working under the assumption that methods that result in similar topologies are optimal.\" It is good to see this acknowledged explicitly because it certainly seems to be implied elsewhere in the presentation of the material. Still, this is faulty logic. My buddy Marc Suchard and I could write two different tree inference programs that give the same tree every time, that doesn't make the tree right. The fact that two likelihood based inference methods employing very similar models of evolution (GARLI and RAxML) yield similar trees might just mean that they methods have the same inference bias.Line 333: I am curious about the impact of single-end versus paired-end read mapping, although any change in results seems likely to be dwarfed by the apparent run-to-run variationLine 345: \"if different nucleotides were called at the position, the one with frequency larger than 50% was the consensus call for that position\" 50% support seems a bit low when there is clear ambiguity in the base call data that will almost certainly influence the phylogenetic inference in some way. it seems like a higher threshold would improve precision in the phylogeny, albeit with a minor loss of resolutionLine 350: \"www.github.com/XXXX\" I will not be able to review the code until the correct link is providedLine 400: how big are these groups? Seems like they should all be pretty small. How does the gsi statistic behave with small groups of e.g. size 2?Line 416: is there any particular reason for using the bootstrapping via seqboot instead of the SH-like support values that FastTree calculates by default?Line 427: how were clade confidence estimates done with raxml? it supports at least a few different approaches.Line 152: the claim is made that \"many more topological rearrangements are required to reconcile FastTreeMP tress with either GARLI or RAxML\" and the reader is directed to Figure 8. It is very very hard to see from this figure how many topological rearrangements are actually required to transform one topology into another. A small number of changes deeper in the tree can create a large number of crossing lines. It would be much easier to interpret a quantitative metric of topological distance such as the symmetric difference, SPR distance, or the generalized robinson-foulds. A second issue relates to the degree of support. It sounds like, based on the methods, that fully resolved trees are being evaluated (at least for GARLI, this info was not given for raxml or FastTree) instead of e.g. 50% or 90% majority rule consensus trees. When there is a great degree of uncertainty in the data, such as would be the case with a large collection of closely related strains, this means that an arbitrary pair of equally likely fully resolved trees may have large topological distances.Line 224: why not mention the case where a closed, finished reference is actually missing a gene common to most members of the species?Line 240 and 175: I do not understand how the conclusion was reached that FastTreeMP incorrectly grouped the outbreak isolates with non-outbreak isolates. Looking at supplemental fig S2 which contains the FastTree results, many of the panels appear to have placed the outbreak strains into a monophyletic group (de novo all, de novo majority) or very nearly so with only one error (snpmat, solsnp, raw majority). More importantly, in cases where FastTree has incorrectly grouped strains, has it placed a high support value on that split? If not then data does not support the assertion that FastTree is doing any worse than the other methods.Line 248: this assertion is only supported if the statement on line 240 is supported.Lines 260-262: agree that more work is needed on model selection for genome SNP data!Line 267: it would be helpful to mention how many SNPs have a pattern that is incongruent with the outbreak vs. non-outbreak splitLine 294-296: whether these conclusions are valid depends on how the FastTreeMP support values lookThe genealogical sorting index (gsi) is a nice way to compare groups in trees, but several important details of how it was applied here seem to be missing. gsi normally requires rooted trees, I believe. How were the trees rooted? Also, gsi can be applied to the entire collection of trees in a bootstrap set, thereby enabling some of the uncertainty in the inference to be captured in the score. Was that done here? Given the great deal of uncertainty present when dealing with such closely related strains it almost certainly should.

Please correct this before publication.The SNP filtering technique used (AF1=1, &gt;=10x coverage) is probably not the best. The Samtools base-caller expects diploid data and attempts to fit the data to a model of allelele frequencies of either 0, 0.5 or 1.0. This is probably not a good choice for bacteria. We prefer to use something like VarScan2 and use a specific alelle frequency cut-off (e.g. &gt;90%). Other groups do something similar. Insisting on &gt;10x coverage may penalise the 454 data. I would have liked to have seen a basic recombination filter e.g. &gt;3 SNPs in 1000 as is standard practice employed too.I am not clear the justification for using GTR+CAT with FastTree and whether any other models were tried.                 I think the authors are to be commended for tackling a difficult subject, and I suppose I agree with many of the conclusions in general. I think the results showing that the k-based methods are inferior to reference-based methods are important.However it is probably worth stressing that these results may not be reproducible between different versions of sequencers and different protocols for aligning, SNP filtering and phylogenetic inference.There is a bit too much emphasis placed on the differences in tanglegrams when the authors conclude that these changes tend to occur in branches without strong support. It is a shame a better tree could not have been constructed (would recombination have helped?).I am _really_ surprised about the differences between RAXML, GARLI and FastTree and I am wondering if anything has gone wrong here, and wonder if this is something to do with the SNP matrix construction. This does not fit with my experience, or with e.g. Liu 2001. Possible ideas are a lack of recombination filtering, some error with the scripts or the wrong choice of substitution model. Given the difference in runtimes between such programs, I feel this should be bottomed-out before publication to check nothing funny is going on.I would like to see the data (e.g. VCFs, SNP matrices) to comment further.

They confirm that crystallin promoters can work across species, as has long been known, and also define functional fragments of the zebra fish promoters. Mass spec detected aA and aBa peptides and provided evidence for eye/non-eye regulation of aBa in development. aBb was not detected.Unfortunately the PCR results are not so convincing. Fig 2, shows aA expression throughout development quite well. Fig 5, however, has poor image quality and, unlike tubulin, the aBa,b primers seem to be generating smaller non-specific bands. These might be solvent front, but the aA and tubulin gels are clear in this region. Were these products confirmed by sequencing? Expression in adult is obvious, but the inconsistent results between panels A and B for embryonic expression are hard to explain. Both show strong bands on single developmental days, followed by almost nothing, which by itself seems biologically unlikely. The difference in timing in different samples is also strange and looks artefactual. I think it would help if this figure was repeated using different primers. The lack of detectable peptides for aBb also raises questions about the PCR. As for the control genes, is tubulin really a good control?

Why functionally assess mouse lens promoters in zebrafish? And how would the authors determine whether negative expression in fish generated from a potentially new mouse lens enhancer would be due to species differences or merely that the enhancer was not a true enhancer in mice either?See Intro: &#8220;This conservation suggests that mammalian a-crystallin promoters could be functionally assessed in the zebrafish, providing a faster and less expensive system than traditional mouse transgenic approaches.&#8221;Furthermore, the authors spend a lot of effort to simply confirm that EXISTING, KNOWN regions of the mouse gene promoter function in the fish. What new is gained here, since these regions were already known to control expression in the mouse as such?See Results: &#8220;Our results indicate that the mouse aB-crystallin promoter drives GFP expression in zebrafish embryos, and that the resulting spatial patterns reflect the functional regions first identified in mouse.&#8221;2. The authors attempt to use promoter driven GFP to assess endogenous onset of gene expression. If an enhancer or modifier is missing in their cloning, then their entire conclusions are in error.

It will be sure to draw media attention. The style of the paper is tongue in cheek throughout. This is most noticeable at the end of the conclusions: &#8220;Therefore this study may be considered a precursor toa more robust experimental design.&#8221;. Sure. Also, table 3. This is not necessarily a problem, as most of the comparable literature is dry as dust and not conducive to anyone actually reading it. In that sense, this was quite refreshing.Assuming that the authors are actually serious, here is my review. Strengths: *Most people ask turkers to do too much, specifically for too long. There is only so much a turker will do. The authors to not make this mistake, as they keep their survey at much less than 5 minutes (which I consider to be the max a Turker will do without resorting to cheating). *The authors provide a plausible mechanism as to why the phenomenon might have gained traction. It is fairly obvious what is going on. People watch more movies that tend to elicit crying (dramas and family movies) on planes (probably due to the available selection) and they are exposed to more movies on a single trip than during an entire year on the ground, with selective remembering and confirmation bias doing the rest. *The authors are willing to report a &#8220;non-result&#8221;. This is very important and should be supported.*The paper is well written. This is rare enough to note it here. Major concerns:1.\tAre the authors fighting a strawman? Most of the people cited in the background are directors and movie people. I was entirely unaware of an impending epidemic of AALS, didn&#8217;t even know it is a thing. I fly a lot, but have never seen anyone cry on a plane (of course, I have seen many people watch movies on planes, including myself). As the authors state themselves, there are no academic studies on this. Their own pubmed search came up empty. Then again, it is important to dispel myths and urban legends before they gain much traction. Then again, why does it matter what a couple of neckbeards in their basement posting on the internet believe about who cries on planes? The authors would be well advised to google the &#8220;Mandela effect&#8221;. Thousands (millions?) of people online are willing to believe that it is more likely that the Illuminati changed the timeline of history rather than questioning the perfect veracity of their memory. 2.\tAs the authors do report a non-result, adequate power is critical. I strongly advise the authors to elaborate and clarify their power analysis. I must confess that I do not understand it. As far as I can tell, no suitable power analysis was performed. This is particularly important as what the authors report relies on the pilot data, which might misrepresent the true effect size. This is true both for the section on power, as well as anywhere else power is mentioned in the manuscript, e.g. when talking about the Learning curve analysis. I did not find this compelling. Please clarify/elaborate. Moreover, 1,000 participants sounds like a lot, but it really isn&#8217;t. In this context, it is important to note that Turkers are not actually real people in this sense. There are all kinds of problems with Turker samples, see for instance https://osf.io/cv2bn/Minor concerns:1.\tI was surprised that turkers fly so much. And saw a movie on the plane &#8211; so were presumably flying long distance. Is this plausible, given that they work for minimum wage on the internet (less than other jobs in the gig economy, e.g. Uber drivers)? In other words: Do turkers fly (this much)? A priori, I would have expected Turkers to be the least like sample to do so, and thus the least suitable to address this study. Maybe I misunderstood what the authors report, but I don&#8217;t think so. 2.\tPlease clarify the modeling of the crying behavior. The text (and the model) implies that crying was binary (cried or not), but the table suggests otherwise. 3.\t219: (Saheli) is Saheli 2017, no?  4.\t264: Learning curve analysis? This comes out of nowhere. Elaborate. 5.\tIn general, put a space before an opening parenthesis. They seem to be missing throughout.

Unit test should be also included (ideally for every one of the 21 functions implemented), to ensure that the software deals properly with edge cases, non-standard inputs, etc.- Test data: Please provide a simple example of test data set. Please also provide a test data set when non TA-based markers could be used.- Dependencies: the TAGMA software tool relies on a number of external dependencies (BLAST, Bowtie. etc), however the repository lacks information on how those dependencies should be installed and configured; how the process should be changed to accommodate Windows and Mac users.

The authors mention that they have created a database of toxin and antitoxin genes for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera (Lines 31-32, 83, 117, etc), however this database has not been made available for the potential readers. It is not completely clear, are the authors referring to a blast database, a list of gene locus tags or is it more than that? In the latter case, the database might be of interest for a broad audience, so some sort of an interface should be provided.                 1. Most importantly, the focus of the manuscript seems to be vague. Currently the manuscript balances between a description of a bioinformatics software tool to perform strain profiling in metagenomic data and a study of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus TA II systems occurring in a few human metagenomic data sets. If the software is made the primary focus, the quality of the code and documentation should be improved dramatically, to ensure that the tool receives enough trust to be used by a broader audience. If a study of TA II systems is made a priority, than considerably more data sets, including a wider selection of publicly available human gut metagenomes should be analysed.2. Provided analysis in the paper considers TAS II systems in two bacterial genera: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Hence, the title of the manuscript is misleading, in its current form it implies much broader use of the software. If a broader use is indeed plausible, the authors should provide additional evidence that the TAGMA software can be used for other genera of bacteria and archaea. Otherwise, this claim should be reduced and the title of the manuscript - revised.                 1.

"], "10.7717/peerj.3306": ["The manuscript has clear and professional English, and has good overall quality. However, the background and rationale was not convincingly proposed and  some literature was not relevant, which makes research questions and hypotheses too unilateral and too ideal. &#9670; In the Introduction section, though the authors explained SSHM very clear and definitely, the rationale was not robust. One of the reasons is that, the key studies repeatedly appeared in the manuscript were all from the same research groups. For example, in Page.4, the authors used only one REF(4), then directly proposed two self-functions. It&#8217;s not convincing enough. And the following description about these two self-functions and the possible mediators were all with the similar pattern.&#9670; Besides, some REFs were either too irrelevant or too general. For example, in Page.6 Line. 139, it said that &#8220;Selflessness is closely related to self-transcendence (e.g.[18&#8211;20])&#8221;. Though REF 18-20 was indeed research about transcendence, we still did not know the similarity between these two concepts. And later in Line.146~, the authors proposed literature to explain the pro-social behaviors and positive outcomes (REF21-25); however, all these REFs are somehow too irrelevant to the focus of the present research. &#9670; The same problem happened throughout the Introduction, and Discussion. For example, in Page.23 Line.565~, REF42-46 were proposed without proper explanation about the association with the research findings or research rationale. It, again, seems irrelevant and confusing.                 In Methods, key information was not sufficient, such as the sampling method, validity of the measurements, &amp; statistic analysis.&#9670; How did these voluntary participants in Study 1 &amp; 2 find out the information about this research? Besides their age, were any other background variables measured?  Why did they need 24 hours to finish the survey? Is it possible to influence the results?&#9670; The description about instruments was not sufficient. There should be validation processes to prove that Self-Transcendence + Connectedness = Selflessness, and Egocentrism + Materialism = Self-centeredness. Especially, as shown in Table.2, the correlation r between Self-Transcendence and Connectedness was only .31. Is it proper to say that Selflessness is the conjunction of Self-Transcendence &amp; Connectedness? Is it proper to use an average score of these two concepts? (Same query could be applied to Egocentrism &amp; Materialism, where r = .38)&#9670; Another question is about the factor analysis. In Page.14 Line.338 &amp; 340, the authors provided factor loading as .86, .78, .85, &amp; .74. Only four numbers, so it means only average scores of four scales were utilized in the factor analysis, not all items of these scales? It's definitally not a proper way to exam the structure stability. &#9670; Furthermore, the purpose of the FA was confusing. As mentioned above, it should have reasonable rationale about ST + C = Selflessness, and Ego + Mater = Self-centeredness.&#9670; And is it necessary to repeat all the analysis of Study 1 allover again in Study 2? It's not clear why.&#9670; The description of the validity of most measurements in this study was too brief. For example, Feeling of being in harmony was developed by Dambrun (REF40), but was this scale ever used in other studies?                 The conclusions contained too many repeated descriptions about research results. It should be more  discussion and comparison with other empirical studies and relevant literature.             Comments:&#9670; There's no information about statistic methods and software in both studies. Did the authors use SEM in Study 2? If so, where's the report of Goodness of Fit?&#9670; There's no single REF in Discussion (Page.15-16 &amp; Page.22-23). &#9670; Page.20 Line.484: not sure what does &#8222;5000 samples&#8220; mean.&#9670; And is it necessary to repeat all the analysis of Study 1 all over again in Study 2? It's not clear why.                                                ", "1. The Introduction includes two distinct references to each hypothesis at different sub-sections. I suggest specifying each hypothesis once and only in the end of the Introduction. I think this will improve the readability of the article and will cut unnecessary repetitiveness in the Introduction.2. In this article fluctuating happiness is only expected to correlate with self-centeredness, and authentic&#8211;durable happiness is only expected to correlate with selflessness. The author does not specify the reasons why fluctuating happiness is expected to display a non-significant correlation with selflessness and why authentic&#8211;durable happiness is expected to display a non-significant correlation with self-centeredness. Please clarify the reason why they are expected to be unrelated.3. Some of the terms used in the Introduction need further clarification:- The text in p. 4 lines 81-82 indicates that the self can be experienced at \"different levels\". Please clarify what are the different levels in which the self can be experienced- In the text in p. 6 line 137 the author postulates that selflessness is a form of \"self-based psychological functioning\" but this doesn't seems logical. This seems to be an error since selflessness can&#8217;t be self-based. Please use a different expression (than self-based psychological functioning) or explain how &#8220;selflessness&#8221; is a form of self-based psychological functioning.- In p. 6 lines 137-139 the author suggests that selflessness is based on a \"small distinction\" between self and environment as a whole, including others. This should be further explained as it isn&#8217;t clear from the text what a &#8220;small distinction\" means. Does it refer to a sense of connection between self and environment?- In p. 6 lines 140-142 the author suggests that selflessness would be primarily guided by the principle of \"harmony\", in the sense that the individual is facing an \"optimal adjustment\" with the different elements of the environment.\" Please clarify what the term &#8220;optimal adjustment&#8221; refers to. Is this a close relationship with the different elements of the environment?4. In several occasions in the Introduction and Discussion some of the terms seem to be wrong or could be replaced by more appropriate terms. Here are some examples:- P. 3 lines 67-68 say \"It assumes that the self takes different structuration\". I suggest to use the word structure.- P. 3-4 lines 75-78 say &#8220;The experience of self is based on the processing of the sensory system (vision, kinesthetic, hearing, etc.), the treatment of the motor system (the underlying action) and the treatment of systems involving emotional, cognitive, and motivational operations.&#8221; I suggest to omit the words &#8220;treatment&#8221; from this sentence.- p. 29 lines 674-675 says \"these two studies are based on correlational devices\". The word &#8220;devices&#8221; might be replaced by the word &#8220;methods&#8221;.Minor comments:- On p. 25 lines 609-612 the author may want to reference the following study in which selfless processing of experience was related to decentering, attention to the present moment and non-judgement of experience (Hadash, Plonsker, Vago, &amp; Bernstein, 2016, Psychological Assessment).- In Tables 3 &amp; 5 please describe which variables are controlled under the \"Partial &#946;\" column.- In Figure 1b the lables of the processes \"Self-Centeredness\" and \"Subjective Fluctuating Happiness\" seem to be switched.- On p. 18 line 440 the author refers to Table 3. The appropriate Table seems to be Table 4                 Since the study was conducted on a French sample some of the measures probably needed translation from English to French. Please describe the procedure by which the measures were translated into French.Where the measures back translated to ensure proper translation? (for a Translation and back-translation procedure see: Geisinger, 1994, psychological assessment)                 1. The author used a principal component factor analysis with a varimax rotation. Varimax rotation is an orthogonal rotation which creates orthogonal/unrelated factors. However in the Introduction the author describes self-centeredness and selflessness as two distinct but related processes. Therefore, an oblique rotation seems to more appropriately fit the theory stated in the Introduction. Please explain the rational for using a varimax rotation. If the author believes that self-centeredness and selflessness are related processes he should consider reanalyzing the data using an oblique rotation which allow factors to be related.2. On p. 24 lines 586-589 the author state that in the studies the two factors were unrelated or modestly related. This is an artifact of the varimax (orthogonal) rotation method that was used. This will always be the case when conducting a Varimax rotation. This should be clearly stated in the article.3. p. 24 lines 592-593 says that subjective authentic&#8211;durable happiness was related only to selflessness. However the results from Table 3 suggest it was also related to self-centeredness in study 1. Therefore the word \"only\" in this sentence needs to be omitted.4. On p. 26 lines 638-639 the author infers causality from correlational findings presented in the article (\"the mechanisms by which self-based psychological functioning operates and affects happiness\"). The wording needs to change as to reflect the correlational nature of these findings.             Comments:I appreciate the author's conceptualization and the operationalization of self-centered and selfless psychological fundtioning. I think this article is important for this field of research and deserves publication but requires several revisions before publication.

Comments:The authors present an argument that that the work of Schwanhausser etal as well as other, previous analysis of absolute protein levels across genes have under estimated the role of transcription in determining protein levels. Although the specific merits of the quantitative analyses they preform could be debated, I think this is nice work that presents a controversial argument that should be published.  However, there are major issues that the authors should address:Major issues:Issue 1. The title: \"System Wide Analyses have Underestimated ProteinAbundances and Transcriptional Importance in Mammals\"The title \"Transcriptional Importance\" makes little sense.  I would suggest the following title: \"System Wide Analyses of Protein Abundance Across Genes haveUnderestimated the Importance of Transcription\"Issue 2. The authors should remove all of the results with non-expresed genes.  These inflate the authors estimates of the contribution of translation. For instance, R2 = 1 for non-expressed genes is meaningless.  One could just say that all genes are not expressed as protein and this same result would be obtained.  An ROC analysis would be better, but the proteome data only goes to a limited depth into the expressed proteome. The R2 of 0.96 reported in Figure 6 for all genes is driven by the nonexpressed genes.  The protein data only allows sampling of up to a limited minimum copy number per cell.Issue 3. One possible alternative analysis would be to consider a new data set of absolute protein abundances that goes deeper into the proteome such as:Nagara et al. Deep proteome and transcriptome mapping of a humancancer cell line Molecular Systems Biology 7 Article number: 548doi:10.1038/msb.2011.81 andBeck et al The quantitative proteome of a human cell line. MolecularSystems Biology 7; Article number 549; doi:10.1038/msb.2011.82Can the authors show the nonlinear effect in these data as well?Issue 4. Can the authors answer: are the translation rates estimated by Schwanhausser et al correlated with the translation estimates obtained from ribosomal foot printing? Is the difference in variance driven by outliers?Issue 5. The authors should describe the limitations of iBAQ and related measures of absolute namely that might not be very reproducible and that the absolute abundance of estimates of individuals genes cannot be trusted without additional verification. e.g. cite Peng et al.

Their main finding is that gremlin 2 was lost in the common ancestor of ruminants and cetaceans based on synteny analyses. They also report that rates of evolution are accelerated in this gene in camels and pigs. These conclusions are of some interest, but much of the rest of the paper is highly speculative. Specifically, the authors suggest that GREM2 constraints phenotypic evolution and that its loss in ruminants + cetaceans has promoted phenotypic variation of cetartiodactyl dentition including the loss of the incisors in ruminants. This conclusion must remain highly speculative because GREM2 is pleiotropic (as acknowledged in this paper) and it is now clear if its loss in ruminants + cetaceans is associated with increased phenotypic variation in teeth or some other function. I have some suggestions and comments below to improve the paper.1. Dasypus novemcinctus (nine-banded armadillo) also lacks incisors, but retains a putatively functional GREM2 gene based on NCBI Gnomon prediction software and the available genome sequence (AAGV03193281). So, it would appear that GREM2 loss is not essential for getting rid of incisors.2.

Pholidota is perhaps the most interesting laurasiatherian because pangolins are edentulous (toothless) and have been so since at least ~45 million years ago. The presence of a putatively functional copy of GREM2 in Manis javanica (JSZB01000348) confirms that this gene is pleiotropic and functions outside of tooth development. The occurrence of a functional GREM2 in Manis javanica also suggests that deciphering and understanding the evolutionary history of this gene in mammals, including cetartiodactyls, is more complex than just tooth development. 3. The authors should provide basic information on the GREM2 gene including gene length, length of coding sequence (including variation among taxa), the number and length of different exons. It appears that their analyses are based on a single exon, but this should be stated somewhere.  4. The legend for figure 4 should include more information on secondary structure symbols. 5. Line 121. Why were second codon positions excluded from phylogenetic analyses? This is rather unconventional.6. The authors should make their full alignment of nucleotide coding sequences available (or perhaps I missed this somewhere). 7. The authors conclude that rates of molecular evolution are accelerated for GREM2 in cetartiodactyls (camels, pig), but have not investigated whether or not this accelerated evolution is associated with positive selection or neutral evolution. The authors should perform selection analyses to determine if positive selection has occurred on key branches (i.e., stem and crown cetartiodactyl branches) in conjunction with this rate acceleration.

Please comment, preferably with literature references for methodological justification.Measurement:  With respect to Schaller et al. (2011), it appears that a key new result is a  COP path difference as indicated in Fig. 6.  However, I am unconvinced by this result for two reasons:  (1)  This is a qualitative interpretation of what appears to be two single trials.  What about all of the other trials?   (2)  The substrate reduces the threshold of detectable pressure, so it is possible that the loss of the &#8220;J&#8221; shape is caused by measurement resolution change, and not by altered biomechanics.Statistics:   Data analysis appears to be primarily descriptive, based on representative trials or on mean / SD values.

Some small comments on methods are included in general comments.                 No comments.             Comments:This study examines differences in pressure and ground reaction force in ostriches moving over sand and solid ground. Locomotion over deformable substrates is not well-understood, so further research is welcome. The authors find differences in center of pressure location, trajectory, touch-down pattern, and ground reaction force shapes between speeds and substrates. Before this study is ready for publication a few areas of concern should be addressed. The most important areas include improving the description of the results which describe center of pressure differences as well as clearing up angle of attack confusion. These and smaller issues are discussed in greater detail in the following comments. Abstract- Move interpretation of angle of attack differences into discussion. 45-61- At least a brief mention of SLIP models should be made here. 119-120: \"The traces...\" Too vague; doesn't contribute information and should be included in the methods rather than here. Introduction: The authors could emphasize more how locomotion on granular substrates is less well studied that solid substrates. A credit to Schaller et al. 2011 near the beginning of the methods would be appropriate given that this study's methods seem to have been based on theirs. 123: It is worth noting whether the subjects were adults or juveniles.Figure 2: Views of feet are mislabelled: b and c should be switched.Figure 4: A histogram would show these data better.195: Provide more detail on the angle between toes measurement needed- how was the axis of the toes determined. 206-216: These patterns are a major part of the paper's findings; make sure their description is clear. Lead the relevant section with the time being discussed- first or second half of stance, then compare/contrast the shape and location of the CoP, making sure to treat them separately before summarizing the patterns. Take more space if needed, and make sure sentences are clear and not too complicated. Figure 6: The authors should consider highlighting the first and second halves of stance, or coloring the dots differently to ensure readers follow the descriptions. Also need a description of what pressure result is being shown.251: Why is 8A not compared to 7A here rather than 6 which does not show the change through time?Why are the GRFs from walking on solid ground not more obviously 2-humped? Schaller et al. 2011 results are similar, is it a result of using  a pressure pad rather than a force plate?According to the results from Schaller et al.  2011, some of the trials recorded here as runs would include grounded runs. This is worth mentioning. 318: \"running\" -&gt; \"walking\"336-337: The relationship between GRF and the skeleton alluded to here should be made explicit.341:  Attack angle/angle of attack appears here but not in results. Are the results inferred from the timing of toe pressure readings or are they from observed kinematics? Additionally, the definition of attack angle given here seems likely to be wrong; an angle created by the sagittal plane of the 3rd toe would be heading/compass direction, I believe this should be a medio-lateral plane. Further, the authors state that the attack angle in sand is smaller than on solid substrate, but on solid substrate the toes and claw hit closer to the same time which would suggest a smaller angle of attack, at least both by an intuitive sense for what angle of attack should be as well as how it is defined and used in Li et al. 2013.  The authors may be using attack angle when they mean angle of intrusion (see Li et al. 2013).  Make sure terminology is consistent and clearly defined. 348-350: This seems contradictory, how can the foot produce more force AND not sink as deep if the area is reduced? It seems like depth should increase as force increases and area decreases. 350-352: Seems to be saying the arch provides additional support in sand but the overall area of contact both of the foot and digit III is smaller in sand.366-367: I agree for walking, but for running the 4th toe only goes from 23 % to 14% and has a similar peak. If the contribution in sand is going to be discounted for running, a stronger argument needs to be made why ~2/3 contribution is insufficient to perform the stabilizing role. 380: I think the toes extend while the TMP flexes: \"The interphalangeal joint excursion mirrors that of the TMP joint during stance\"- Rubenson et al. 2011Raw Data: I don't think that QQ&#162;&#207;-+20141227212259.png [filename is probably mistranslating into roman characters] is meant to be in the 0802A1 folder.A supplemental movie of representative sand and solid trials would be a good addition to this manuscript, the same trials shown in figure 7 and 8 would make sense.                                                ", "This manuscript reports on walking and running of ostriches on two substrates: a hard substrate and a granular one (sand). The data collected consist of plantar pressures and high-speed video using three cameras yielding 3D kinematics.The main focus of the manuscript is on a comparison of the plantar pressures in the four conditions. Overall the manuscript certainly has the potential to contribute to our knowledge but several issues outlined here would need to be resolved.Even though the kinematics part has been described in some detail in the text and in figures, unfortunately the manuscript does not report on them except in the Methods section lines 180-185. In the results no details are provided even for speeds, which I think they are crucial in order to provide context to the roll-off patterns and &#8220;ground reaction forces&#8221;. I addition, speed measures combined with stance times (which are known from the pressure plate) would yield duty factor which will differ between walking and running, but potentially also between substrates.The authors might want to publish full 3D kinematics in a separate paper. In that case I would reduce detail on the 3D analysis in the Methods section, but still include at least speeds and duty factors in the current paper.In contrast to the kinematics, which should be available have not been reported, ground reaction forces (GRF&#8217;s) _have_ been reported even though they have not been directly measured. I am aware that numerical integration of pressure over area should, in theory, yield ground reaction forces and I think that is how these have been obtained, directly from the pressure plate software (lines 193; no further details provided). There are at least two caveats with this. Firstly, by definition only vertical GRF&#8217;s would be obtained, not shear forces (fore-aft and left-right). Vertical GRF&#8217;s will certainly be larger than shear forces, in magnitude, but esp. the fore-aft force is important in braking and propelling the body and the capacity to deliver this force may be affected by a loose substrate such as sand (this is briefly touched upon in line xxx). Secondly, accuracy of the pressure sensors is inferior to that of force plates and integrating pressures will at best lead to a fairly good estimate of vertical GRF with a well-calibrated plate (interestingly, pressure plates are often calibrated by putting them on top of a force plate and comparing the output). Whilst I do not object at all to the presentation of these &#8220;GRF&#8217;s&#8221; I think the manuscript should provide some more detail on the GRF calculation and acknowledge the caveats in order to remove the impression that the GRF&#8217;s presented are highly accurate, as they would have been when measured with a dedicated force plate.The manuscript style is overall very understandable and clear but the English language needs checking by a native speaker.Reporting is rather descriptive. I do not object to descriptive papers but the material presented here lends itself to more functional interpretations. This has been done to some extent in the Discussion, but this is very brief and might be a bit random with relatively high detail on some aspects (e.g. lines 343-352) while some obvious related work has not been discussed. I think, for example, about work by Falkingham and colleagues on the mechanics of footprint generation in granular media. There is a body of literature on theropod locomotion which I think is worth considering in order to providing more relevance to the results from the current study. I think the paper would benefit from the inclusion of a few clearly stated research questions or hypotheses in the Introduction, and a Conclusion with clearer take-home messages (i.e. more about what the findings mean than a description of observations such as the shape of the CoP trajectory).Figures are relevant and of sufficient quality. Some legends need improving or clarification. For example: -\tFig 2: what is &#8220;Isometric view&#8221;? -\tFig. 4: what exactly is the vertical axis, &#8220;Quality percentage&#8221;? This should be made clear here or in the text. Alternatively the figure might be skipped and average +/- s.d. of particle size presented. This might give similar or even more useful information to the reader whilst saving some space. Details on how particle size was determined are lacking.Some minor issues:-\tLines 45-48: walking (when defined as a duty factor &gt;0.5) is not necessarily dynamically equivalent to inverted pendulum and running is not necessarily equivalent to spring-mass (see many papers from researchers like Biknevicius, Full, Hutchinson, Kram, Seyfarth, etc.)-\tIt should be made clearer throughout the manuscript about which species statements are made if they are not general. For example, lines 372-375, this is about humans but since the previous sections were about ostriches this might be somewhat misleading.-\tLine 75, since solidification is an important concept in the paper I think it merits to be introduced in some detail (a few lines).-\tLine 99: how does a long limb enable high stride frequency? All else being equal, a long limb implies high resistance to rotational acceleration (high moment of inertia).-\tLines 119-120 &#8220;The traces were analyzed qualitatively to add some necessary data.&#8221; This phrase is not very meaningful and I suggest either deleting it, or clarifying which data it is about and why the resulting data are necessary.-\tLine 123: _every_ part of their feet? Please specify which measurements were taken or delete if irrelevant.-\tLines 162 etc.: please specify spatial resolution of the cameras.-\tLine 188: please check if sensor size is correct, or add &#8220;approximately&#8221; if necessary.-\tLine 197: what is an &#8220;ordinary&#8221; camera? ;-)-\tLine 375: what is the disadvantage of a foot strike? Do you mean heel strike? Even so, the question remains.Raw data are available but they do not come with documentation to explain what the files are, as far as I can see. Furthermore the files have Chinese characters as column headers so for most readers the raw data are not useable at this point. All files need to be in English with clear headers and a single &#8220;manual&#8221; document outlining what the files in the raw folder are.                 The study was performed on a limited number of individuals (2 individuals for the experiments, one different individual for MRI scanning). Basic subject data need to be added; the only information currently provided is that the subjects are adult females. Body weight is certainly available as it was used to normalise GRF.No mention is made about the number of trials collected per individual and per substrate type. This is an important omission which needs to be corrected. Biological data are always variable and it is necessary to understand how large this variation is in the current data set especially since only two subjects were studied and since many results consist of &#8220;typical examples&#8221; or averages and means where it is not clear which data went into the calculations and in all cases N is not given.The setup itself is very appropriate and of more than adequate length (80 m) for ostriches.Detail is needed about how the pressure plate was calibrated (Line 199) as this is not always trivial and might have an impact on the numerical results.                 The strength of the conclusions and the overall quality of the paper will depend to a large extent on the amount of data presented.I suggest reporting speed, Duty factors (and potentially but not necessarily kinematics).The effect of sand depth (4cm) on the data merits some discussion. I feel that 4 cm might be a good compromise between deep enough to be realistic (the natural substrate being &#8220;infinitely&#8221; deep for all practical purposes) and shallow enough to allow recording of pressures (less would be better). Nevertheless, it is almost without any doubt that different depths will result in different results and this observation merits at least a paragraph in the Discussion. For example, the plantar surface area values presented in Table 1 for the sand are in my opinion not true plantar surface areas but rather how pressure is transmitted down into the substrate onto the pressure plate, where the forces will be spread over a larger area than where they are produced at the foot-sand interface.The &#8220;ground reaction forces&#8221; presented in Fig. 10 are puzzling. If animals have no overall vertical displacement (which I&#8217;m sure is the case over the 80-m long runway) then their average vertical impulse over a stride must always equal body weight. Judging by the area under the curves, this value (presented in _absolute_ body weights) seems lower on the solid surface but the horizontal axes are _normalised_ for stance duration. I can only make sense of these plots if the solid ground involves a longer duty factor (longer _absolute_ stance duration), which is an extra reason why i think such data need to be presented.More statistics information is required; it had not been dealt with in the Methods and it seems that tests were not performed at all, e.g. to test for significance between conditions (substrates, gaits) or between individuals.The Discussion includes interesting ideas (e.g. Lines 348-352, another potential reference could be water running in basilisk lizards). Presenting some kinematics of toe motion might strengthen these ideas.The Discussion would benefit from a critical evaluation of shortcomings or potential issues (some of which outlined in this review).

"], "10.7717/peerj.3243": ["1. The article is well written and the language is clear. The introduction provides sufficient background on the recent challenges and advances in the field of virus taxonomy. In that respect, some additional references might be included to illustrate the application of networks to the study of viral phylogeny and taxonomy. For example, Jang et al (J. Virol. 2013, 87(23):12866-78) used a phylogenomic network to assign a newly described phage to the phiKZ group, and Iranzo et al (J. Virol. 2016, 90(24):11043-55) studied the archaeal virosphere and related plasmids using bipartite networks. 2. There seem to be some inconsistencies with the calls to figures in the text. For example, Fig 3B is called from l.317, l.352 and l.356 when discussing VC2, 3, and 14. However, none of those VC appear in Fig 3B. In a similar manner, Fig 4A does not contain VC59, as it would be expected based on its call from l.382.3. The archaeal subset of Figure 2 would gain from further clarification on the symbols used. For example, in its current form it is unclear whether all circular nodes (e.g. those between VC51 and VC74, or those at the bottom) actually belong to Lipothrixviridae. It would be useful to know what that relatively large connected component to the right of VC74-77 contains. Moreover, I wonder about the location of the archaeal virus members of the Caudovirales, as well as Bicaudaviridae, Turriviridae, Sphaerolipoviridae...4. Other minor observations:- Reference (Edwards &amp; Rohwer, 2005) cited in l.89 is missing.- It would be interesting to see the edge weights represented in Fig 2 and 3.                 1. The research question underlying this work is well defined, extremely relevant and meaningful. As explained in the introduction, the use of networks for viral taxonomy is arising as a promising direction that may overcome the limitations of classical approaches. Because of the relevance that this work may have in paving the way for a new approach to viral taxonomy, it is essential that the methodology follows the highest standards. In that regard, the decision to treat the bipartite virus-PC network as a projected (unimodal) genome similarity network seems a bit surprising, if not hard to justify. In the 9 years passed since the publication of Lima-Mendez (2008) new developments in network science have made it possible to analyze bipartite networks directly as they are, without the need of being projected. Specifically, the two network properties exploited in this work (modularity and betweenness centrality) can be now easily studied in bipartite networks. Projection of bipartite networks (i) is arbitrary (i.e. there are several ways to do it and it is not obvious how different procedures affect results); (ii) results in a loss of information (e.g. in the projected network it is impossible to know if two genomes are similar because they share a common set of core genes, a sparse set of horizontally transferred genes, or just genes acquired from the host); and (iii) may introduce structural biases, such as spurious scale free topology (see Monta&#241;ez et al, Bioessays 2010, 32(3):246-56). As a result, there has been a well justified shift towards studying these networks from a bipartite perspective, not only in the context of phylogenomics (Corel et al, Trends Microbiol. 2016, 24(3):224-37) but also in broader fields such as ecology (see, for example, Flores, Valverde &amp; Weitz, ISME J. 2013, 7(3):520-32) and social sciences (for example Borge-Holthoefer et al, Plos One 2011, 6(8):e23883). That said, the use of a unimodal projection might be, perhaps, justified if the analysis of the network involved algorithms which do not have a bipartite counterpart yet, such as some self-consistent techniques to detect multiscale modularity (see below). 2. The choice of a particular module detection algorithm is naturally subject to some degree of arbitrariness. However, there are some theoretical and practical arguments that make MCL a particularly controversial option for defining viral clusters. From a theoretical perspective, despite MCL finds sets of nodes that look like &#8220;reasonable&#8221; modules, such sets do not comply with any rigorous definition of what a module must be. As a result, there is no consistent way to assess if the modules are &#8220;good&#8221; or if one possible partition is better than another. This is a serious drawback, especially if one wants to evaluate the statistical validity of a module (i.e. how unlikely it is that a similar module appears by chance in a random network with the same degree distribution). From a practical perspective, the value of the inflation parameter is an arbitrary choice, with different values typically leading to modules of different size. In the context of viral taxonomy, it is possible that different taxonomical levels are recovered by using different values of the inflation parameter (unfortunately, because there is no rigorous theoretical basis for the algorithm, there is no guarantee that modules obtained with different parameter values are consistent subsets of each other). In any case, if MCL is used as the module detection algorithm, the choice of a particular inflation parameter should be well justified, and the robustness of the results with respect to different parameter values should be evaluated. Other module detection algorithms, such as those based on the Newman&#8217;s modularity index (Barber&#8217;s modularity for bipartite networks) or on information theory are free of these problems and allow interesting extensions, such as the possibility to find hierarchies of modules at different resolutions in a consistent way. Obviously, the latter possibility would be especially interesting for taxonomic applications. It is also possible (e.g. OSLOM algorithm) to evaluate the statistical significance of nodes within a module in order to discard spurious modules or nodes assigned to the wrong module. For an extensive review on the available methods (up to the date of their publication), see Fortunato, Phys. Rep. 2010, 486(3-5):75-174 and the more recent but less comprehensive Fortunato &amp; Hric, Phys. Rep. 2016, 659:1-44.3. A desirable property of the PCs is that they should be easily extendable to accommodate proteins from newly discovered viruses. However, based on the definition of PCs as the straightforward outcome of the module detection algorithm applied to the sequence similarity network, it seems that every time new viruses are added to the network the PCs have to be rebuilt from scratch. This drawback could be avoided by using existing sets of viral orthologous genes, such as the pVOGs (Grazziotin, Koonin &amp; Kristensen, Nucleic Acids Res. 2017, 45:D491-D498), so that new sequences can be added in a consistent way based on profile comparisons with the existing orthologous sets.4. Other minor points:-  Please define or explain the meaning of the terms in equations (1) and (3).- The sentence in l.194 is hard to understand. - It says in l.339 that the number of genomes of a given group was doubled computationally. The meaning of this sentence is not clear to me. Does it mean that replicas of those nodes were added to the networks? What was the weight of the links between the original nodes an its replicas?                 1. Despite the methodological caveats described above, the main conclusion of the work, namely that viruses can be studied as a network whose modules represent taxonomically meaningful units, seems reasonable. However, some specific results may be partly derived from a lack of resolution of the algorithms used. For example, the article describes some instances of &#8220;lumping&#8221; that can be resolved by hierarchical clustering of the affected VC. It is thus possible that more sensitive module detection algorithms can split those groups in a more precise way. Similarly, it is possible that some of the viruses that \"do not seem to belong\" to the VC to which they are assigned were removed if the statistical significance of nodes within modules were assessed.2. Concerning the discussion on the betweenness centrality of Mycobacterium phages, it should be noted that the betweenness centrality in a unimodal genome similarity network must be interpreted carefully. For example, based on the high betweenness of a single representative of T5-like phages, Lima-Mendez et al (2008) concluded that T5 is a mosaic virus that acts as a bridge between T4-like viruses and lambda-like viruses. The subsequent analysis of the bipartite virus-PC network carried out by Iranzo, Krupovic &amp; Koonin (2016) revealed that most of the core genes shared by T5-like viruses and lambda-like viruses are widespread viral hallmark genes, which are also present in T4-like viruses. Therefore, the apparent bridge location of T5-like phages in the unimodal genome similarity network was likely an artifact derived from the loss of information in the projected network, together with the incomplete sampling of the T5-like viruses. As pointed out by Corel et al (Trends Microbiol 2016, 24(3):224-37), the most suitable approach to the detection of mosaic genomes would be the study of the bipartite network.3. More specific comments: - The statement &#8220;It is remarkable that all known archaeal viruses not only fall within the network, but that most of their VCs follow a genus-level affiliation&#8221; (l.454) seems inconsistent with the statement &#8220;archaeal virus were incorrectly classified at the genus level&#8221; (l.292). - The subsection title in l.293 seems inappropriate, as long as it is later stated that some VCs include viruses that should be assigned to a different VC (e.g. Eucampyvirinae from VC1 to VC87). Perhaps &#8220;Gene content analyses suggest ICTV classifications should be revised&#8221; would be a better title. - It would be interesting to see a plot similar to Fig 2C, but showing the statistics about the number of VCs in which  ICTV groups split.

Perhaps &#8220;Gene content analyses suggest ICTV classifications should be revised&#8221; would be a better title. - It would be interesting to see a plot similar to Fig 2C, but showing the statistics about the number of VCs in which  ICTV groups split.

Comments:This is an interesting paper that uses proteomic similarities to explore viral (primarily phages and viruses of Archae) taxonomy.In general, the approach of using proteomic analysis in which the predicted encoded proteins are assorted into related groups (PCs) and the distribution among genomes is compared, is not new per se, and mirrors approaches used by others. However, the analysis is more sophisticated and more robust, and has been incorporated into an online tool that can be used by the community if they wish to get a report on the taxonomy of any newly sequenced genome. In general, this makes for an interesting and informative analysis, especially when compared with alternative taxonomies such as that proposed by the ICTV.The paper goes into considerable details on discrepancies between the VCs reported here and the ICTV classifications. On line 267 it states that 76.4% of the 211 VCs contain a single ICTV-accepted genus, concluding good concordance between the taxonomies. However, this also indicates a substantial level of discordance, and although the basis for this is discussed briefly, some further explanation would be helpful.  For example, there is a discussion of the VCs with 2 or more ICTV genera, but not much explanation as to the basis of this discordance.Although the paper is overall well-written, some parts are quite impenetrable. This is exacerbated because of the apparent lack of legends for the Supplementary figures. Perhaps they are in there somewhere, but I couldn&#8217;t find them!  For example, Fig. S2 shows the mycophages with high BC values, but the figure is difficult to interpret. Why are some &#8216;high&#8217; BC genomes labeled and not others. What is the x-axis? What VC(s) are the labeled phages in? This was not easy to figure out from the Supplementary Tables. What is the explanation for these particular phages having these characteristics? Could it be related to mobile genetic elements in part that are more broadly distributed than other genes?For the enterophages and mycophages there have been prior attempts to group phages according to relatedness using other measures including gross nucleotide similarity (see Grose &amp; Casjens, 2013; Pope et al., 2015). It would be of interest to determine the concordance of the VCs with the clusters identified using those methods. In the prior studies, there is also some consideration of other hierarchical levels, including super-clusters and sub-clusters. How do the VCs and the other parameters such as BC vlaues compare to these? These comparisons would strengthen the paper and the utility of the analyses.The manuscript discusses some of the profiles that are seen with phages having different degrees of mosaicism. The underlying reasons are perhaps obscure, but it is worth noting that the relatively large group of sequenced mycophages share the property of being able to infect the same host strain, a characteristic that is rare among other phage groups. Thus the relationships reported among the mycophages could be a rare oddity, or they could reflect a feature that is common among phages but which is not apparent because of the variety of host strains used for propagation. This does not appear to be the case for Synechococcus phages, but how these observations relate more broadly elsewhere in the phage community remain obscure. This is perhaps worthy of some discussion, while also noting the need for expanding the very limited current collection of sequenced phage genomes.The paper is clearly data-rich, but the small labeling on many of the figures and supplemental information make them difficult to read.In Figure S1, Min1 is incorrectly labeled as a mycobacterium phage, whereas in Table S1 it is correctly identified as a Microbacterium phage. Perhaps this was a result of a manual adjustment, and if so, some additional proofreading might be helpful.                                                ", "no comment - all good.                 I felt the others experimental design was well thought out and examined during various stages of analysis.                 no comment             Comments:The authors describe a new method for the binning and taxonomic assignment of dsDNA viral sequences called vconTACT. It is a clever approach that will aid the field of viral ecology. They showed in a robust way, bioinformatically, the need for increased sampling of phage groups/clusters where the resolution or similarity to the ICTV classification was not attained. This has been seen in phylogenetics and shown again here using their method.Major:Lines 50-74: I&#8217;m confused by the approaches listed. While they are valid and great examples they are not inclusive as it might be assumed by the reader. Also, it was unclear if the focus was on the computational approaches as stated at Line 50. Mizuno 2013 &#8211; a great study, is a string of smartly organized previously described computational tools. Also there are other studies to list in some of these categories. And, the authors, I believe, are targeting their introduction on marine viromes and this should be stated as there are many approaches within infection disease fields and other human-associated microbe/viral areas. I am also curious why the authors chose to focus so much on the marine environment in the introduction (although I realize this is the corresponding authors main environment), when vconTACT was not evaluated with environmental sequences in this study. Perhaps slight rewordings and compaction of this section of the intro could help clarify.Line 77-80: The authors discuss gene flow &#8211; the transfer of genes. Are they referring to genes shuttled between viruses or between viruses and their hosts? Or is the flow of genes from one population that mixes with another population. Since these are non-sexual organisms/entities the exchange of alleles through classical interbreeding would not be a process. Please clarify. When discussing gene flow &#8230; I understand why temperate phage may be more susceptible to gene flow possibly during &#8216;sloppy&#8217; extraction from the host genome during viral replication, however, during lytic infection could viruses also pick up genes from degraded host genomes etc? I&#8217;m not as familiar with this literature as the authors likely are. Could they comment and also provide references for the statements that lytic would be less likely to evolve as a result of gene flow. Also, the statement that dsDNA viruses might not be a susceptible to evolution through gene flow compared to the fast evolving RNA and ssDNA viruses should be referenced and clarified. Fast evolution of RNA and ssDNA is usually due to higher mutation rates (as compared to dsDNA phage and other cellular organisms), not necessarily gene flow. Gregory 2016 was cited at Line 278, which does discuss physical differences and also states &#8220;Mechanistically, while gene flow in bacteria and archaea can occur from multiple sources, gene flow in viruses is restricted to times when two viruses co-infect the same host. Such &#8220;co-infection&#8221; need not be simultaneous, but it does require spatial proximity and shared host range.&#8221; So throughout this manuscript gene flow refers to co-infected phage. Again more clarification is needed.The section from Lines 414-424: appears to not fit within the Autographivirinae section, perhaps I missed something. Also, I don&#8217;t see VC22 in Figure 4B as referenced. VC 2 is there but has only Staph phage, I believe &#8211; the resolution was a little low.Could the authors draw any conclusions about how to discern &#8216;lumping&#8217;/gene flow/mosaic genomes using bioinformatics (where no ICTV or other references are present, i.e., from purely environmental bins) based on this study? And, perhaps this should be discussed in the conclusions.Minor comments:Line 57: &#8220;These studies have added 15,222 and 125,842 new virus sequences &#8230;&#8221; I realize based on the previous sentences that these are genomes and large genome fragments, but using sequences could be confused with reads and genes which is obviously much more. Perhaps consider merging the two sentences or providing more specific characterization of the sequences.Line 102: following iii) consider revising for clarity, &#8220;which for the oceans at least represents &lt;1% of the viral genomes recovered&#8221;.

", "I enjoyed reading the present article \"vConTACT\" in which the authors use a whole-genome approach (via protein content) to taxonomically classify known microbial viruses (from the reference database) and compare their approach with the current system provided from the ICTV. Then, this tool is integrated within the Cyberse cyberinfrastructure for the public to use it.This is essentially an extended version of a previous work from the authors, where now, they include a higher number of reference viral proteins derived from a higher number of viruses and examine the inconsistencies between their method and the current taxonomy (there is a ~24% of non-concordance at the genus level).I am curious to know how much \"vConTACT\" has changed since the iVirus publication (July 2016). The article is well structured, detailed in the literature, figures are informative and with nice aesthetics, and the results seems sound.I was, however, very confused with the use of the tool itself and I think that the article needs to add more clarification and details on how to use this resource. There are several versions of vConTACT in the \"Cyverse Discovery Environment.\" Then, assuming that version 0.1.60 is the correct, there is no explanation on how to proceed to analyze users viral sequences. There are 2 other \"Apps\" for vConTACT: PCs (2 versions of it) and \"genes2contig.\" The information button provides no information. This should be well addressed.The Introduction section sets very well the current problem and the need of a new/complementary viral taxonomy in this big data era. However, the authors refers here and there to viruses in a general term and should be a bit more precise when they refer at least to DNA viruses or RNA viruses, which are very different. For instance, the 3 approaches they describe (lines 51-62) are discovering exclusively DNA viruses, and the 2 tools described (lines 92-98) are tested in RNA viruses. These RNA/DNA terms should be included to set up a better context of what is being done.In Lines 25 and 120, the authors mentioned that the current tools is \"optimized\". Please add how it is optimized.   Line 57, the reference Paez-Espino, 2016 should be updated (or complemented) with Paez-Espino NAR 2017 where they add ~250k viral sequences.Line 119, can the authors say up to what taxonomic level they are confident to assign?Line 145, In this method section details of the BLASTp need to be included.Line 153, when is considered significant?Line 250, how many singletons were found?Line 267, if 76.4% of the data agreed at the genus level with ICTV the authors should say that \"Thus, roughly 3 out of 4 of the VCs corresponds to ICTV genera\" in line 270.Line 288, to be consistent with the whole sentence, add here the family of the VC2 (I think it is Siphoviridae).Line 290, same thing here than the previous comment (add family ... Myoviridae?).Table1, VC: what is a significant number of genes? can a percent be added?Figure3, Caption should include the color code and not refers to Figure2.Figure4B, Viral species are illegible.                 The work, although not original, represent a considerable increase with respect to the previous work in 2008. The work seems very well defined and the authors have done a very good job investigating deeply the inconsistencies.A couple of questions here:Is the tool only based on PCs shared or does it also consider some gene synteny?The authors mentioned that some microbial \"cargo\" genes may lead to a wrong taxonomic assignment, have the authors considered removing microbial gene hits?

"], "10.7717/peerj.335": ["The manuscript is generally well written. The background to the study is well presented. While importance is not one of the editorial criteria, the study does make a very useful contribution to what is known about patterns and predictors of change in typical and atypical language abilities from 2-3 years. The readability of the manuscript could be improved by rearranging some of the text. In the Introduction, Law et al.&#8217;s (2012) study is first discussed on line 99 (the age of the children needs to be included here) and then again on line 110. I suggest bringing this information together in the same paragraph. The variables associated with typical and atypical language development in the first three years of life (i.e., the rationale for inclusion of these variables in the current study) need to be discussed in the &#8216;Introduction&#8217;. Currently, the rationale for the independent variables is included in the &#8216;Methods&#8217;. A related issue is that information that belongs in the &#8216;Introduction&#8217; is included on lines 119-124 following the first research question. The background to the research questions should lead up to the research questions and follow the research questions. Not all the literature cited is appropriately referenced and all the citations need to be checked for accuracy (e.g., Zubrick et al.&#8217;s. (2007) study is incorrectly cited as a study of language outcomes of late talkers). I have a query about the citations for the European French version of the CDI-2 (100 words) at 24 months. The children in Kern&#8217;s (2007) study were much younger than children in this study and the children in Reilly et al.&#8217;s (2007) study completed an Australian adaptation of the English version of the CDI: Words and Sentences (680 words).  Citations for the European French version of the CDI-2 need to be included here. In the &#8216;Results&#8217; it is puzzling why only 3 characteristics of the participants were discussed in the text (i.e., CDI-2 score, family history, bilingualism). It would be useful if summary statistics for the 4 groups of children: &#8216;Consistently TL&#8217;, &#8216;IVL&#8217;, &#8216;RL&#8217; and &#8216;CLL&#8217; were included in Table 1. The names of these 4 groups are not sufficiently intuitive or well known to justify the use of the abbreviations in the text and table titles.  The names of the 4 change patterns rather than abbreviations should be used where practical to do so.                 The data source is the EDEN prospective mother-child Cohort Study. Data on the participation rate of women on entry to this cohort should be provided.  In addition, the characteristics of the cohort need to be compared with the characteristics of the reference population. Sample attrition is well described. Information about access and use of data from the EDEN Cohort needs to be included under the heading &#8216;Data source&#8217;. The research questions could be simplified and numbered for ease of reference and reiterated in the &#8216;Statistical analysis&#8217; and &#8216;Discussion&#8217; sections. The risk factors under investigation in this study were referenced to a 2006 systematic evidence review (Nelson et al., 2006). Epidemiological evidence about risk factors for early language delay (as discussed in the Introduction) is the appropriate source of data to justify the choice of risk variables for this study. As stated earlier, the rationale for the risk variables belongs in the Introduction. In the text, the risk variables need to be grouped under the same headings used in the tables and discussed in a logical order (e.g., child, maternal, family factors). The levels of each of the independent variables and the reference category for each variable should be documented in the Method and this should be consistent with the reporting of the variables in the tables. Child age is an important variable and warrants more detail about the correction for age.                 The parameterization of the independent variables in the analyses (Model A1, A2, A3, B1 and B2) needs to be checked in the text (and the tables) and explained under the heading &#8216;Statistical analysis&#8217;. For instance, why is the reference category for &#8216;Number of older siblings&#8217; is &#8216;&gt;1&#8217; instead of &#8216;no siblings&#8217; (i.e., &#8216;0&#8217;), which represents the lowest level of risk. The &#8216;Breastfeeding initiation&#8217; variable needs further explanation (e.g., what was the time period for initiation of breastfeeding?).There is insufficient information about the two dependent variables: CDI-2 and the ELOLA. There is no information about the psychometric properties of the CDI-2 and the ELOLA and this needs to be detailed. The rationale for choosing a score below the 10th percentile on the CDI-2 as the criterion for identifying children with language delay at 2 years needs to be included under the heading &#8216;2-year-old measure&#8217;. More information about the ELOLA is needed. For example, is this a standardised omnibus test that yields standard scores for each subtest and a standard score for overall performance on the test? The rationale for calculating z scores for the ELOLA needs to be provided. In the &#8216;Abstract&#8217; and the &#8216;Discussion&#8217; the direction of the associations between independent and dependent variables needs to be specified (e.g., &#8216;lower frequency of maternal stimulation&#8217;, &#8216;higher level of parental education&#8217; etc.).

The manuscript presents on the interesting topic of predicting language skills in young children and predicting change in language skills between 2 &#8211; 3 years old. Factors that may influence early language skills and the trajectory of language impairment are current topics of interest amongst several groups of researchers. The results of this study add to this body of literature and are in line with previous findings such as those of Henrichs et al. (2011) and Reilly et al. (2010).                 The research questions were clear and similar to questions posed by previous research, but nonetheless meaningful and with a different longitudinal dataset. It was helpful that the authors used the same categorization groups as Law et al. (2012) to examine trajectories of change as was presenting the attrition rate analysis. It might be useful to comment on the attrition rate in the current study relative to previous published research.The language measure at 2 years is markedly different to the language measures used at 3 years. Perhaps this is one possible reason why language skill at 2 years is limited in predicting language skill at 3 years. Having said that though, the authors do identify this issue in the discussion. The analysis is appropriate to the research questions posed.                 The discussion concerning the &#8216;delayed&#8217; effects of biological factors (alcohol during pregnancy, birth term and breastfeeding) was interesting but I was left wanting a further explanation from the authors as to why biological factors show \"increasingly evident effects as cognitive abilities become increasingly sophisticated\".

Comments:Review of PeerJ-34316-v0DisclaimerPlease note that I am a molecular biologist and toxinology researcher with very limited knowledge of deep learning and associated fields, and this review is confined to those aspects I am capable of addressing.General commentsThis article describes the development and testing of TOXIFY, a deep learning algorithm aiming to classify toxins or non-toxins based on their primary structures. The problem addressed is a worthwhile one, and the manuscript has been carefully prepared. From the data presented, the authors have produced an algorithm displaying considerable increases in both accuracy and speed compared to both traditional annotation methods and previous machine learning approaches. My main issues with the manuscript relate to how the algorithm has been tested, and how those tests are presented in the manuscript. These are listed below. I recommend the manuscript is suitable for publication after revisions to address these issues and/or the authors have responded to these issues raised. &#8226;\tSection 3.3.2: I am not sure this section demonstrates anything meaningful. Am I right in thinking that all it shows is that Toxify identifies more ORFs as toxins than BLAST searches do? If so, this may or may not be a desirable feature, depending on whether these many thousands of additional sequences actually represent toxins or not. From what is presented, there is no reason to think that this is the case except the assertion on lines 157&#8211;159 that &#8220;Because many additional venoms are known to be present in these taxa beyond the number indicated by BLAST searches, this highlights TOXIFY &#8217;s greater predictive power compared to BLAST-based approaches.&#8221; A more convincing demonstration would test the ORFs in this way and then compare the results to some kind of empirical classification of if the protein sequences were venom or non-venom, most ideally if they can be detected in venom by mass spectrometry. Surely this would be possible for one of these or another well-characterised species?&#8226;\tSection 3.3.3: I also have several problems with this section: (a) that the test consists of a single &#8216;positive&#8217; sequence and no negatives; and (b) that this sequence appears to belong to a protein superfamily (inhibitor cystine knots) that is represented not just in asilid venoms but also the venoms of numerous other animal groups, particularly spiders and cone snails. This means that although this test does indeed support the applicability of Toxify to &#8216;other venomous animals&#8217; not included in the training group, the scope of this may be considerably more limited than what is inferred. How would Toxify perform on the numerous other protein families recently discovered in asilid venom? Ideally, I would like to see the study measure (or at least discuss the issues surrounding) how &#8216;novel venomous taxa&#8217; vs. &#8216;novel venom protein families&#8217; affect Toxify&#8217;s performance.&#8226;\tTable 1: This table compares the performance of ToxClassifier and Toxify on the negative and positive datasets described on lines 79&#8211;81: &#8220;a positive dataset with all 274 verified venom protein sequences and a negative dataset with 274 randomly selected and verified non-venom protein sequences.&#8221; Tested on this dataset, Toxify is in general more happy to classify things as venom proteins, and has a substantial increase in true positive (TP) and decrease in false negative (FN) with only very slight increase in false positive (FP) and decrease in true negative (TN). However, the ToxClassifier algorithm seems to have been designed and tested on quite different datasets. The negative dataset used to generate Table 1 seems to more closely resemble the &#8216;easy&#8217; dataset used in the Gacesa et al. 2016 article (10.7717/peerj-cs.90), whereas the &#8216;moderate&#8217; dataset in this 2016 study consisted of sequences with blast homology to verified toxins but that were verified non-toxins, more similar to that described in 3.3.1.

However, few changes and corrections throughout the text should be made to improve readability. Authors should provide accession numbers for the sequencing raw data.                 Research questions addressed are relevant and clearly defined. The methodology described cannot be completely reproduced by another investigator, therefore, it needs to be expended (see general comments). Bioinformatics and statistical analyses seem to be correctly conducted, however, I do have some concerns regarding the methods and approaches used (see general comments).                 The manuscript shows that an exposure, via ingestion of contaminated food, to a sub-lethal dose of an organophosphate pesticide causes significant shifts on the gut microbiota of the japanese quail. Authors discuss and speculate about the potential impacts that such shifts might have on the health of birds. However, there was no treatment to assess recovery after exposure, which could have indicated to which extent the exposure poses a treat to the health of these birds. Furthermore, there is no discussion about the role of the microbial groups that are changing in the GIT. I am not, by any means, an expert in gut microbiota, but a shift in taxonomic groups not necessarily means a shift in function. Perhaps, the author could try to fill this gap by analysing their 16S rRNA data with PICRUST.             Comments:IntroductionL64-73: what are the concentrations that are representative of exposure levels on the filed (environmental relevant concentrations)?L77: Are birds exposed to pesticides only by food ingestion?

Material and MethodsL115: ad libitum, rather than ab libitum???L121-L125: what was the age of the birds at the beginning of the experiment? Definitely more than 4 weeks. What is the life span of these birds? In the introduction authors mention that GIT microbiota play an important role in the development and maturation of the immune systems. Is this relevant for these birds? L126-130: Authors used a model to estimate pesticide residue of avian food sources, however, nothing is mentioned to indicate that the concentration of pesticide used to estimate the residue is the concentration normally applied of the field. L149-150: Conditions used for PCR relations are not indicated. L157: what were the non bacterial OTUs, archaea?L162: what was the reason for choosing the NCBI Microbial database for taxonomy assignment? It seems to me that authors could have chosen a more appropriate database like SILVA. L164: Provide accession numbers.L170: is 9999 times correct? Or it was used 999 times?L166-178: No singletons and doubletons were discarded. This might have a significant effect on the analyses performed, especially because authors performed all the analyses on OTU level.  L178: I was not able to access the webpage provided as source of the calypso software. ResultsThe results section is rather descriptive and many of the results indicating shifts on the GIT microbiota are presented on genus or species level. I would be very careful to base my results on such lower levels. It is well know that OTU clustering algorithms are far from perfect and also that erros introduced during the preparation and sequencing of the samples might have an impact on the diverse and taxa observed. Moreover, some of the results presented show changes on taxa that are present in a very small relative abundance. Would the discard of singletons and doubletons change the observed results? The substitution of the word proportional by relative might improve readability (example L227, 233, 237, etc.).

I dont believe that all bacteria that responded positively to the exposure did so because they are able to degrade the insecticide.

The ingredients used to formulate the feeds as well as the percentages included should be reported. On line 117, the impression is given as if no premix of vitamins and minerals was used, but only sodium, copper, calcium and selenium was added.                 There are several flaws in the exeperimental set up. On line 113, it appears as if birds were housed 4 per cage. With 20 birds, that means 5 cages, thus not evenly distributed over the 2 treatments. It is also unclear whether the males and females were housed separately. It is well established that cage effects on microbiota composition can be very important. It is unclear why fecal samples were used. Moreover, it is well known that birds produce two types of droppings, cecal droppings and colonic droppings. the former are much more sticky and thus can be distinguished from the latter. It is unclear which type of droppings were used here. Moreover, it is inclear how long after defecation the feces were collected. this may have considerable influence on the microbial composition.                 the data may be biased by cage effects, distribution of the sexes over the cages, the limited numbers of animals (2 groups of 5 for each sex). In the discussion the authors (mis)use literature data. for instance; when refering to the paper of Li et al., 2016) they use the Blautia argument, but they dismiss that Li et al. also found an increase of Desulfovibrio associated with improved FCR, which is in conflict with their findings and with their reference to Shin et al (2015). Moreover, the paper of Shin et al. relates to mammals, not birds. another example: there are just as many studies showing that Lactobacillus probiotics have no beneficial effect. there are studies showing that Akkermansia is enriched in studies showing beneficial effects of prebiotics.             Comments:Ideally, the analyses of microbiota should have been done on the same animals before and after treatment. there are conflicting reports whether faeces are representative or not for intestinal microbiota.

Briefly, the canopy gradient of seed composition of ten soybean lines was measured in a period of 3 years time.  Raw data was properly normalised to avoid fluctuations related to the environment and genotypes. The authors were able to show that seed protein, oil and minerals accumulate in different patterns according to the canopy gradient. A simple and elegant experiment showed that protein and oil accumulation is regulated by a process other than that of mineral distribution in soybean seeds.The vegetative soybean ionome could have been linked to the expression analysis of key genes involved in metal homeostasis and remobilisation.  However, results presented are satisfactory to support the main idea of this work. Results regarding the Fe concentration of food products made of soybean seeds coming from different canopy positions are interesting and of great importance for the field of human nutrition and health in developing countries. Also, the main novelty of this work is the new insights about the physiological mechanisms that may underlie these positional effects.Having said that I strongly recommend this paper for publication.

Especially, Fe is among these, and authors demonstrate that soybean processed products can be enriched in Fe if prepared from bottom-derived seeds, a simple and yet important application of the findings.

Figures are well designed and relevant but the labeling could be improved (see suggestions).                 All methods used are well described, experimental procedures and analysis are relevant. Results obtained revealed the complexity of seed filling when considering all required nutrients, and the role of leaf for remobilization, according to the canopy structure.                 The manuscript by Huber and collaborators provides a wealth of data on the effect of canopy position on protein and oil concentration, seed and leaf ionome in soybean (10 soybean lines, 3 years). The duration of the seed filling period as well as the impact of microenvironment on seed ionome are considered. It also shows that the composition of soy food products is directly linked to the seed ionome. The link between the leaf soybean ionome and the seed ionome has also been investigated.

The Introduction lists two factors affecting the development of seed at the top of the plant differently than those at the bottom of the canopy: the seed filling period, and the role of canopy microenvironment. Yet the impact of remobilization or rather the impact of nutrient mobility is discussed further. This aspect could be added in the introduction. 2. I can appreciate the data here and the amount of effort that goes into a study like this one. The data looks quite interesting and will be informative for readers. However, the figures could be improved to reach more homogeneity that will help the readers. For example, the comparison between raw data provided in Figure 2 and normalized data provided in Figure 3 would be facilitated by the establishment of a precise order of seed composition traits: always &#8220;SampleWeight&#8221; in first, &#8220;Percentage of Proteins&#8221; in second, etc&#8230; In the same way, the different elements of ionome never appear in the same order in the different figures. It will help the reader to identify the data when focusing on only one element.. Figure 2 in which the raw data is supplied is very interesting but this figure and the following need more information on the figure itself and in the legend. For example, what is the unit of &#8220;SampleWeight&#8221; (individual seed weight ? as explained page 5 Line 120). It should be added in the legend of each figure, and reminded for proteins, Oil, and Fe (Figure 2). Please place the label &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8221;B&#8221; in figure 2.What is the real meaning in the different legends of &#8220;(p&lt;1e-10)&#8221; ?Figure 9 : Unit of the Y axis for sucrose is probably wrong. Which line(s) was used for these analysis ? This should be indicated in the legend3. Line 282, the statement &#8220;Opposite patterns were observed for other minerals (Ca, Mn, K and Cu) suggesting that remobilization is either mineral specific or not quantitatively important in delivery of minerals to developing seeds.&#8221; was made. We have an opposite pattern for Ca, Mn and Cu. However, there is no obvious canopy gradient of seed for K, only in leaves.  As a result, readers may not conclude to an opposite pattern for K.Similarly, line 262, authors state that Se were highest in leaves at the bottom of the canopy as shown in Fig. 8 but Se quantification is not given in the figure.4. Line 169, a highly correlated element pair as illustrated in the normalized plot correlation matrix (Figure 4A) has been forgotten: Ca- Mn.5. As the authors noted, differences of nutrient accumulation in seeds as a function of canopy position could reflect the differences of mobility in the phloem. It has already been shown that given minerals tended to have a high mobility in phloem while others have a low mobility in phloem. Then references need to be cited, lines 390 (White, 2012 for exeample). The particular effect in 2010 on Ca, Mn and Sr could be explained in the discussion (line 392). Indeed, the weather conditions and more particularly the above normal precipitations could be responsible of these modifications. The water availability is then probably linked to the ability of Ca and Mn to be remobilized via the xylem (Maillard et al., 2015 ; Dayod et al., 2010 ; Malone et al., 2002 ; Nable et Loneragan, 1984&#8230;.). Theses paper could be used to broaden the discussion on leaf remobilization (lines 281-283).In the same way, in the discussion (lines 394-395), the authors don&#8217;t return on the impact of microenvironment on the concentrations of minerals. Only the sentence &#8220;Changing the microenvironment altered the protein and oil gradients but did not affect observed gradients for most of the minerals&#8221; gives the conclusion. Yet, the microenvironment has an impact on Ca, Mn and Sr, the same elements affected by particular conditions of 2010. This point would merit further discussion.Minor comments :Page 1, line 4 : what the aim of the second symbol after DeMuro ?Line 134 : not really obvious for Zn, except in 2010, or Sr (line 140)Line 199 : There is also a strong correlation between S and Mo that could be notedLine 262, Se in not shown in Figure 8Line 362 : does not ?Line 502: mg/ml, line 504: mg/mL, line 530: &#181;gml-1 &#8211; please use uniform units.

", "This manuscript is well organized and generally follows the scientific format; however, to be acceptable for publication it requires substantial revision in regards to the following:1) The writing itself, while good, does need substantial work to improve the clarity and flow of the paper. Significant polishing of the text is necessary before being acceptable for publication. I provide some suggestions in the General Comments to the Author, but further polishing of the text will be required.2) The Introduction wanders and does not really get at the purpose of the study and hypotheses/predictions tested by the authors. Much of the Introduction contains &#8220;filler&#8221; text about the species that is not particularly germane to the current study. In my view, the authors really need to focus on why understanding the winter diet of four-horned antelope is of interest. To do so, they need to really draw on the ungulate diet literature in general, and what is already known about FHA diets specifically. I was surprised that much of the reference on FHA diets was not mentioned earlier in the Introduction (but it was in the Discussion). This literature needs to be the backbone of the a revised Introduction, accompanied by a solid rationale and hypotheses (if applicable, see my comments below). Most importantly, the purpose of the study needs to be made crystal clear.3) Too much of the text focuses on Banke National Park itself, FHA in Banke National Park, or studies on ungulates in Nepal. In my view, the authors need to focus the paper on diets of FHA while at the same time broaden the scope of the paper to ungulate diets in a global context. That is, I recommend that the authors a) delete much of the text about Banke National Park that has little to do with the current study; b) consider what is known about FHA diets and ecology across their range, not just in the park or Nepal; and c) draw much more heavily on the ungulate diet literature globally, than specific to Nepal.4)  There are many instances where I thought unnecessary information was provided by the authors that is not of the type that is normally provided in scientific papers (e.g., Lines 117, 123, 134, and others), and this information should be deleted.5) The captions for Figure 1 and Table 1 need to provide much more detail about what information the figure and table provide. They should be able to stand alone.6) Please iInclude both the common name and scientific name at first use for all species (e.g., barking deer at Line 70; tiger at Line 99, Hyena hyena at Line 107, and others).7) Please avoid starting sentences with numbers.                 I have difficulty evaluating the experimental design of this study because there really isn&#8217;t one there. In essence, this is a descriptive natural history study that doesn&#8217;t really aim to test any meaningful hypotheses. That is not a judgement on the value of the work, just to state that it is quite descriptive and not experimental.As noted above in the Basic Reporting section. The research question is not well developed, and the context to assess whether it is relevant or meaningful, or fulfills an important information gap, is lacking. I want to believe that it is relevant and meaningful, but I need the authors to explicitly develop that argument for the reader; rather than having the reader trying to figure that out for themselves.In terms of the study methods/techniques used to determine FHA diets, the authors do a good job of following standard protocols for microhistological analyses of ungulate diets from fecal samples. I have few substantive issues with how the work was done and, generally, it is reported to sufficient rigor to permit the study to be replicated. Good work.Some methodological questions that should be addressed in a revised manuscript include: 1) How easily was it to determine FHA pellets from those of barking deer, or any other sympatric ungulate that also defecates pellets? It is quite important that the paper address the reliability in distinguishing between the pellets between FHA and sympatric species with fecal pellets that are similar.2) If fresh pellets (within 7 days &#8211; Line 133) are important, then the authors need to address how they could ascertain this in the field, taking note that in arid environments pellets may dessicate at different rates in different habitats (see: Jung and Kukka. 2016. Wildlife Biology 22: 160-166; Hibert et al. 2010. European Journal of Wildlife Research 57: 495-503). 3) The authors need to describe in detail the sampling protocol for obtaining reference collections of available plants that FHA may use as forage.                 The data from this study are robust and statistically sound &#8211; I have few substantive issues with the methodology employed.A major issue that is only partially addressed in the manuscript is that the data come from a single year, at a single study site, during a single season. This imposes some major limitations on what can be inferred about the diet of FHA, and the authors need to tackle this limitation in the Discussion. For instance, how representative is this study area of the vegetation communities found across the range of FHA? Was the climate and weather typical the winter of the study, or might the availability of some of the forage resources vary from year to year, resulting in differences in use by FHA?As noted above in the Experimental Design section, this is a descriptive study so the ability of the authors to link conclusions to supporting a priori hypotheses are limited.Finally, a minor point, but the authors should discuss the limitations of microhistological anaylses. For example, some forage classes, such as forbs, are chronically underrepresented in microhistolocical analyses, which will bias the results.             Comments:Overall, I&#8217;d like to state that I enjoyed reading this manuscript and believe that it strives to fill an important gap in our knowledge of the ecological requirements of FHA. Thank you for doing this study.I believe that through a critical and substantive edit to focus the manuscript on the question at hand &#8211; while more broadly drawing from the global literature &#8211; this study would be most appropriate as a Note or Short Communication in a mammalogy or zoology journal, such as Mammal Research, Mammal Study, Mammalia, or Mammalian Biology. The data is certainly valuable, but is limited in it&#8217;s spatial and temporal scope, which restricts making broader inferences about FHA diet.

Paragraph starting at line 188: Based on the methods, I understand that only the three strains showing significant differences in growth were screened for contamination in wells. For two of these three, wells showed evidence of contamination, which suggests that perhaps wells for the other 45 strains may have contamination as well. Is it possible that growth differences could be masked by contamination? In other words, perhaps strain A in the &#8220;ground&#8221; plate grows to a higher density than the same strain in the &#8220;space&#8221; plate, but the space plate was contaminated with strain B, which is unaffected by microgravity and therefore grows to the same density as strain A?

Comments:The authors investigate how microbes isolated from human-associated built environments on earth behave on the International Space Station using an agar-based growth assay developed to address the challenges of microgravity. This work emphasizes non-pathogenic strains in order to understand the microbial ecosystem of the ISS built environment.I enjoyed reading and reviewing this paper. What might seem like a &#8220;simple&#8221; growth assay is made quite complicated by the microgravity environment of the ISS, and the authors clearly presented the challenges and their solutions.                                                ", "Minor comments regarding presentation:Line 51: '...this bacteria&#8230; is improper grammar. It should be modified to 'this bacterium' or 'this strain' or 'these bacteria'. Line 64: 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa' should be used instead of just 'Pseudomonas', particularly given that the authors are referring to species not genera. Line 65: The authors should replace &#8220;normal&#8221; with non-pathogenic. There is nothing abnormal about pathogenic microbes, and the fact that the authors bracketed normal with quotation marks, implies they also do not think non-pathogens are more normal than pathogens.Line 69: The use of 'While' implies a time-dependent comparison, which the authors are not making in this sentence. 'Although' would be more appropriate in this circumstance. Lines 72-74: This sentence is a bit of a stretch. The referenced article by Kembel et al., 2012 (reference 14 in this manuscript) did not discuss the idea of lack of competition among microbes as being a contributor to the increased pathogen load in ventilated hospitals. Kemble et al. did discuss the idea of reduced dilution of the indoor microbial community by mechanical ventilation compared to window ventilation, but did not invoke any idea of significant interaction among the microbes as being the cause of increased pathogenic species between the two systems. This sentence, as it currently reads is fairly misleading as to the work that was performed and the conclusions drawn in reference 14. The authors should rewrite (or better, omit) this sentence as it does not really support their premise that the microbial community-at-large can affect the persistence and virulence of a pathogen. The premise itself is fine, and supported in the next sentence. Lines 80-81: 'Therefore' should be followed by a comma, as it is an introductory phrase.   Line 93: What does 'double-dilution streaked' mean?Line 99: What were the criteria for 'human interest'?Materials and Methods section: There appeared to be no mention of using uninoculated wells as controls (blanks). The authors stress that they used clear agar, however, LB itself is not optically clear, and would need to be taken into account for the OD measurements to be meaningful. It would be good for the authors to note the inclusion of this control.  The Table 1 legend should indicate that the reported ODs are for the 96 hour time point.                 The authors use a non-standard method for measuring OD (for understandable reasons) but do not present any supporting data validating their approach. The authors describe in detail how measurements are taken (lines 174-183) and that a given OD measurement results from a combination of 'number, diameter, and thickness of colonies'. Given the integration of these three variables, what is the relationship between OD and cell number? Traditional (broth culture) OD measurements are compared to dilution counts to establish the relationship between OD and cell number for a given strain, what is the relationship between OD and cell number for a culture growing on a solid medium? In my opinion, this approach could be validated by comparing the OD measurements to dilution plate counts obtained by resuspending the plate grown cells into buffer using a bath sonicator. Clearly this approach is infeasible on ISS, but could be performed on earth to establish the connection between plate OD and cell number. Inclusion of such data would greatly support their conclusions.                 The authors claim the ISS environment is much like built environments on earth except for the gravitational force and cosmic radiation. They note that temperature and relative humidity are similar. What about pressure and oxygen concentrations? Clearly ISS is maintained within parameters that will support humans, but is the ISS similar to pressure and oxygen concentrations that would be experienced at sea level or in the Rocky Mountains? Because the authors are only comparing growth in Davis, CA to the ISS, the assumption seems to be that B. safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2 will exhibit nearly identical growth dynamics everywhere on earth, as long as the temperature and RH is controlled.

Software exists, but is not open source, slow, properly validated, complex and not flexible. A new software is introduced that uses Julia, a novel programing language, that is claimed to be simple and communicates well with Matlab, a closed source package often used by researchers. They implemented a couple of DCEMRI models and implement fitting routines in a straightforward fashion. the result is quantitative maps that can be used to infer tissue properties. The method is explained with many equations. The software is validated using the recent DCEMRI digital phantom data made available by the QIBA group from RSNA. The software is shown to be QIBA compliant. Furthermore a a single breast MR from one breast is used as an example. It claims to be open source, portable, faster.Comment.1. This is a highly technical paper that may not be suitable to this journal. Readers would be interested in using the software, but not in how it is working. 2. The open source model for this software is not clear. It is now living in the GitHub maintained by the first author. This is not going to work in the future. How can one be sure that the software remains QIBA compliant? How about problem reporting? Either one should setup a community or hook up to an existing community. See e.g. VTK/ITK from Kitware, or Slicer. Can this journal also host software?3. The claim of speed is not exactly clear. The tests lack information about hardware, so it is unclear how results can be compared.4. Speed is even more strongly dependent on the implementation of DCE analysis. The authors chose straightforward implementation of DCE analysis methods, like deconvolution. This is notoriously slow. Other methods are available in literature (e.g. matrix based) that are much faster. Probably requires a decision to go for speed or ''simplicity''.5. The T1 relaxation is estimated by assuming a known MR signal model (e.q. 1). This is known to fail for the regular clinical sequences. They just do no fit these standard gradietn echo modesl. How are the parameters derived? Are there other signals models? How should these parameters be derived? 6. The method assumes the availability of a mask. How is that created? Is that available as well?7. The clinical breast MR example is highly unrealistic. It is an MR exam of a single breast and extremely slow. Most likely because the authors selected a sequence in which the signal model does behave as Eq. 1. As I commented in 5, that is not realistic. Regular breast MR should be at least 1 mm in resolution, span both breasts and run under 90 seconds. In that case you will have to use faster sequences, that definitely not fit the Eq.1 model.8. The breast MR is a mere example and not in any way a validation of the method. There is no reference standard, no comparison.

This resulted in the identification of 20 potential disease-associated variants from 18 out of the 20 patients. Following that bioinformatics analyses were performed to investigate the relevant functional subnetworks and pathways enriched for genes carrying these variants. Overall, the manuscript is clearly written, but some revisions are required before the manuscript can be published.                 (1) Causality. Limited by the experiment design and small sample size, this study cannot provide strong evidences that support the identified rare variants are causal. It is also difficult to calculate statistical significance of association of these variants with the disease. As shown all variants except one was identified only once (I assume the variant indented twice are from patients of the same family). Thus, it would be needed to discuss these limitations in the &#8220;Discussion&#8221;. (2) Two of the patients are from the same family. It will be interesting to provide more information about their variants. I assume that these two patients are R0027 and R0029. Do the majority of variants identified shared by them? Genetically related individuals tend to share variants, but may inherit a different set of genetic variants. However, the variants causing the disease should be shared.                 (1) Enrichment analysis. It is not clear what genes are used as background in the network and pathway enrichment analyses. Since these myopia-associated genes were selected by following a filtering protocol that focus on eye-disease related genes. It will certainly result in enrichment of related pathways and GO terms, if the background was not carefully selected (e.g., use all genes as the background for enrichment analysis). Thus the bioinformatics analyses reported in this study may not be valid. (2) In the discussion, the authors described that many of the genes identified in this study have also been identified in previous studies.

So the relationship is not \"unknown\" but definitely an area where more work is required.  I would ask that authors to acknowledge and briefly discuss how these results stand in contrast to the in vivo analysis of the Per1 mutants that show normal rhythms in wheel running behavior and SCN neural activity rhythms (Pendergast et al., 2009; Takasu et al., 2013).I agree with the authors conclusion that this work suggest that Per1 plays a unique, non-redundant role in phasing gene expression and firing rate rhythms in SCN neurons.                                                ", "This is a very clearly written manuscript that is easily follow and read. The background to the problem under investigation is succinctly accounted for in the Introduction. The main Results are presented in four good quality figures and these are all relevant to the findings.                 The design of the studies is clearly described. The authors employ methods and approaches well-established in the PIs lab; brain slices were prepared from mice in which the activity of the Per1 promotor is reported by a destabilized green-fluorescent protein (dGFP) and the relationship between SCN neuronal activity (firing of action potentials as recorded in loose patch configuration) and dGFP expression examined. The authors also use mice with a variety of clock gene mutations to further assess the relationship between the molecular clock and SCN neuronal activity.  Generally, there are sufficient details for the reader to understand how the experiments were conducted and there are no ethical concerns.  An additional explanatory sentence on the Per1-/-;Per1::dGFP mice would be useful as it would be unclear to a reader unfamiliar with circadian biology as to how dGFP would be expressed if there is no Per1. One concern with the Experimental Design is that the authors do not describe where in the SCN the recordings were made (ie. Did they primarily target the ventral or central SCN?). This is important as the pattern of clock gene expression in the SCN is reported by several groups to vary in different subregions of the SCN.                 In keeping with earlier research from the PI&#8217;s lab, the authors find that during the day, there is a positive correlation between the intensity in dGFP (as a proxy for Per1 expression) and the frequency of action potential firing of SCN neurons.  Peak firing activity occurred around the middle of the day, while peak dGFP intensity occurred ~2h later. This positive relationship persisted in subjective daytime SCN recordings taken from animals that had been free-running in constant dark. This relationship was not disrupted by blockade of GABA signalling with gabazine, suggesting that neuronal state is cell autonomous and not dependent on intercellular signalling.  In animals lacking Per1, the relationship was altered such that the peak in dGFP occurs some 7h after the peak in firing. In animals lacking Per2, the relationship was similar to that of genetically intact mice. Finally, in mice lacking both Per1 and Per2, the daytime relationship is lost.  This series of investigation suggests that Per1 expression is pivotal to relationship between the molecular clock and SCN neuronal firing rate. There is an impressive amount of work in this study&#8212;the authors are to be commended for this as these are not easy experiments. On the face of it, this seems a fairly straightforward outcome (for daytime recordings), however, there are some significant limitations that I think the authors need to acknowledge and expand on.i)\tIn the SCN, the dGFP construct is not as widely expressed as other reporters of the molecular clock, such as PER2::LUC.  This suggests then that this construct under reports the numbers of &#8216;clock cells&#8217; and that expression of dGFP has no bearing on the circadian pattern of firing for some neurons.  This makes it difficult to state with absolute confidence that raised dGFP expression=increased firing rate (nb: dGFP-ve SCN neurons also increase their firing rate during the day and reduce it at night).  Similarly, at night, dGFP expression is very low and this makes it difficult to distinguish dGFP+ve and &#8211;ve neurons.

Comments:In keeping with earlier research from the PI&#8217;s lab, the authors find that during the day, there is a positive correlation between the intensity in dGFP (as a proxy for Per1 expression) and the frequency of action potential firing of SCN neurons.  Peak firing activity occurred around the middle of the day, while peak dGFP intensity occurred ~2h later. This positive relationship persisted in subjective daytime SCN recordings taken from animals that had been free-running in constant dark. This relationship was not disrupted by blockade of GABA signalling with gabazine, suggesting that neuronal state is cell autonomous and not dependent on intercellular signalling.  In animals lacking Per1, the relationship was altered such that the peak in dGFP occurs some 7h after the peak in firing. In animals lacking Per2, the relationship was similar to that of genetically intact mice. Finally, in mice lacking both Per1 and Per2, the daytime relationship is lost.  This series of investigation suggests that Per1 expression is pivotal to relationship between the molecular clock and SCN neuronal firing rate. There is an impressive amount of work in this study&#8212;the authors are to be commended for this as these are not easy experiments. On the face of it, this seems a fairly straightforward outcome (for daytime recordings), however, there are some significant limitations that I think the authors need to acknowledge and expand on.i)\tIn the SCN, the dGFP construct is not as widely expressed as other reporters of the molecular clock, such as PER2::LUC.  This suggests then that this construct under reports the numbers of &#8216;clock cells&#8217; and that expression of dGFP has no bearing on the circadian pattern of firing for some neurons.  This makes it difficult to state with absolute confidence that raised dGFP expression=increased firing rate (nb: dGFP-ve SCN neurons also increase their firing rate during the day and reduce it at night).  Similarly, at night, dGFP expression is very low and this makes it difficult to distinguish dGFP+ve and &#8211;ve neurons.

The presented results are a good baseline description of the water quality parameter and its association with bacterial and archaeal richness. Although the manuscript is technically sound, it needs improvement regarding the discussion of the data obtained, which is quite descriptive in nature.

The data and the data analysis are strong and sound which provided a reasonable first step towards a baseline for the water quality and bacterial richness. However, I have concerns about the impact of archaeal results given the experimental set up (item 3 on General Comments).             Comments:Some suggestions are provided below. 1) I could not find in the Material and Methods section whether each site sampled has biological replicates. 2) It is stated that a 10 times greater sequencing effort would be needed to cover/saturate the OTUs richness. Why did the authors use pyro instead of illumina sequencing to achieve just that?3) I am sure there are now available primer sets more suitable to target the Archaea domain (that are based on the alignment of a large number of archaea) than the ones listed on M&amp;M. Why the authors use the same set to target both Bacteria and Archaea?4) A better explanation must be added for the selection points used. For instance, all points seem to follow the shoreline (even TT4, RI, and FI) where the disturbance from the main land river and plumes, probably, would be the more striking. The question would be why not add a transector moving away from the mainland/ river plumes to address how far  this influence takes place both in terms of water quality and microbial richness fluctuations.5) Figure 6 in gray scale is very difficult to read, please change font to black.6) It would be interesting to the readers to have some information about the coral health on the closest reefs during the sampling time and location points.

In its current form the results obtained from this assay looks somewhat forced since selective pressure on resistance development in essence only was allowed in the CIP+Herb combinations.2.\tThe innate mutagenic effect of ciprofloxacin is not tested nor discussed even though that can be considered an alternative explanation for -or bias the results seen in the mutation frequency assays.

This would benefit from the addition of the plasmid maps as a supplemental figure. What did each trait allow?

However, I felt that the methods were not described in enough detail and that there were important controls not included in the experimental design. For many of the experiments, there was no control of the effect of the antibiotics alone on mutation frequencies. There was also no control for whether it was the active ingredient of the herbicides that have the effect, or whether it was other components like surfactants and other ingredients. While I understand that the authors may not think those controls relevant seeing as the herbicides are used as is, as a reader I wanted to know more about what might be responsible.

The discussion here can be more valuable if such potential correlation between fungal community and environmental conditions are discussed. Also, this may be a good place to indicate that phyllosphere fungal endophytes were not studied and warrant future research.

If proper storage is assured, it should be of a lesser impact then the multitude of other variables influencing microbial gut composition.                 This is an original primary research within the Aims and Scope of the journal. Although the research question is well defined, the manuscript lacks in the discussion section a critical reflection of these results in the light of conservation of leopards. Please be more precise, too many statements are too general about gut microbial diversity.Following changes are suggested to improve the technical standard. Take special care to the rationale of performed statistic tests and visualization analyses.&#9827;\tMaterials and Methods: Provide more information on fecal sample collection &gt; what is a fresh sample, how much time after defecation was it collected? E.g. How long was the sample outside in the environment? Meteorological conditions during sampling? Include as well how the samples were collected: what (sterile?!) recipients were used?&#9827;\tMaterial and Methods: I do not agree with the statistical analyses using parametric as well as non-parametric tests. The nature of these data and the small sample size should point towards a non-homogenous and non-normal distribution of the data. Test with assumptions of homogeneity and normal distribution should therefore not be used.&#9827;\tMaterial and Methods: Quantitative (unweighted Unifrac) and qualitative (weighted Unifrac) beta-diversity measures lead to different insights into factors that structure microbial community composition. Assess to what extent unweighted or weighted Unifrac should be preferred for this study.&#9827;\tResults: Please improve quality of figures 3a and 3b.&#9827;\tResults: Reporting of results should be restricted to results, not include again Material and Methods.&#9827;\tResults L214-L226: cfr.

Comments:Thank you for your submission.Please go carefully over the manuscript review comments ranging from important general comments to detailed grammatical comments.Focus on how to increase the validity of findings by choosing the appropriate statistical test and visualization techniques (instead of performing different incomparable tests alongside each other), by increasing quality of figures and writing concise but informative figure legends.Report results strictly in result section, and rephrase wording in discussion section so that the results are actually discussed and not repeated in a 'reporting' format.Although the text generally flows and is written in proper scientific English, please consider remaining grammatical errors. Please take care of referencing (and the reference list) in the correct format, following the author's guidelines of the journal.                                                ", "The manuscript &#8220;Analysis of gut microbiota for free-ranging leopards (Panthera pardus) in China using high-throughput sequencing&#8221; by Han et al. describes a comparison of the gut microbiota of two subspecies of leopards using faecal samples as a surrogate. The gut microbiome of carnivores is still not well understood today and the current study adds to that limited knowledge. Although I consider the study to be mostly solid, I was struggling to understand some analyses performed. The manuscript would benefit greatly from improved clarity of the text and figure quality. I would like to see the work published after a major revision.Introduction, 3 pages:Most of the first two paragraphs of the introduction (lines 45 -- 66) deal with topics not relevant to the current study. I would like to see the introduction and discussion much more focussed: a bit of background on microbiome in wild carnivores, why the authors expect differences between the two populations, etc.Methods, 3.5 pages:Line 145: &#8220;The species sequences were annotated&#8221; the authors are probably referring to the representative sequences of the OTUs. Also, how were the representative sequences chosen? E.g. most abundant or longest sequence per cluster?150: &#8220;The sequences were then aligned using MUSCLE software (Version 3.8.31)(Edgar 2004) to construct the phylogenetic relationship between different OTUs.&#8221; How was the phylogenetic tree inferred?Res, 3.5 pagesDescription of relative abundances of phyla, families and genera in the text is quite lengthy and I feel a table would be more appropriate. I think it is important the authors provide their annotated OTU table as well as summary tables on the different taxonomic ranks so that readers can investigate taxa of interest. Figures: There are 7 figures in total although the PDF generated states 8. There is redundant information in the figures, for example Figure 2 and Figure 3b illustrate relative phylum abundance. Figure 2 and 3 could be combined without losing information. Figure 5 could go into supplementary and Figure 7 could be excluded completely.I also feel that figure quality should be improved. Figures blur when zooming in. I cannot tell if this is an issue with the original figures or the PDF. Figure 1:A colour scheme that makes it easy to distinguish the two groups would be helpful. Also, the legend describes what rarefaction and rank abundance curves are and not what the figure shows. This is also true for some of the other figures.Figure 2:Legend says &#8220;bacterial species&#8221; but shown are phyla.Figure 3:The title is misleading/not informative: &#8220;The dendrogram (a) and UPMGA clustering trees (b).&#8221; Shown is a heatmap and a bar chart of relative phyla abundance with the dendrogram of the clustering as added information.a)\tI do not understand the colour coding of the relative abundances. According to the legend the values range from -4 to 4. This means the values were scaled. How?b)\tI do not understand why phylum relative abundance is different between weighted and unweighted Unifrac. Using different distances can affect the clustering but why the abundances? The legend says &#8220;The unweighted Unifrac distance and weighted Unifrac distance were used to calculate the overall percentages of relative abundance among all samples at phylum level.&#8221; Distances are calculated based on the relative abundances, not the other way round. The legends of the two subplots differ in size.Figure 5:As no structure is revealed by the analysis, I feel this figure could go into supplementary information.Figure 6:Please change the colour scheme to accommodate for red-green blind readers.Figure 7:I question the relevance of this figure. Only three taxa were different. Do we really need a bar chart and a cladogram to show this?Discussion: 6.5 pages.The discussion is extensive and, in my opinion, not always relevant to the results. Often bacterial taxa from the current study are mentioned along with other studies that also found these taxa. The studies cited are then compared much like in a literature review.Also, some parts are better suited for the results section, e.g. lines 268&#8212;273 describe results.I suggest the authors concentrate on the main taxa and where they have been previously been described in other carnivores and on why one might expect differences in the microbiomes of the two subspecies (like they did in lines 339 &#8211; 353).ConclusionsThe conclusions do not refer to the findings of the paper.                 There is no original field study approval document provided, only a text describing why the authors do not provide the original, i.e. that it is in Chinese. The editor needs to decide if this is acceptable.There are different numbers of individuals in the two groups (8 vs. 13) which could be problematic for the statistical analyses. However, as no big claims about significant differences are made I do not consider this an issue. The authors should, however, discuss this issue as a potential explanation for the lack of statistically significant differences.                 The main findings are descriptions of the predominant taxa in the two subspecies of leopards and a lack of statistically significant differences between the two groups (with the exception of the three taxa identified in the LDA Effect Size analysis). I consider these findings valid based on the current experimental design.             Comments:&#8226;\tThe title does not indicate that two subspecies are being compared. Suggestion: &#8220;Comparison of the fecal microbiota of two free-ranging Chinese subspecies of the leopard (Panthera pardus) using high-throughput sequencing&#8221;.&#8226;\tI was not able to access the raw sequence data in SRA under SRP149194.&#8226;\tAs many other papers in the field faecal samples are used to study the gut microbiome. Faecal samples can be used as a proxy but I think this should be mentioned in the text. For example the first sentence of the abstract reads: &#8221;The analysis of gut microbiota provides a non-invasive approach to understand the complex interactions between host species and their intestinal bacterial community.&#8221; This is not correct. Obtaining gut samples is invasive, collecting faecal samples and using them as a proxy for the gut is non-invasive.&#8226;\tReferences are not formatted correctly.

Figure 4: please clarify that you are talking about &#8216;bee abundance&#8217; in the caption                 Lines 148-155: For readers who are new to remote sensing techniques, could you please provide a brief explanation of what EVI and NDVI are and why they are appropriate for your study questions? This is important for readers to be able to interpret the results. I think EVI is more suited to assessing seasonal patterns?? So how/why does EVI differ from NDVI and why did you use these? Any information that will help readers understand the relationships shown in your results will help.Lines 172-174: Please also provide some detail (either here or in the results) about whether the collecting method affected results? There is a huge difference in the number of hours that traps were open for across years (4 vs 24 hrs), and this would have significantly affected the relative abundances you collected. How does the model you used genuinely account for this discrepancy; or would it be better to omit the 2010 data from the analysis?                 Line 239: I think the difference in patchiness arises at different scales, e.g. natural ecosystems are usually more patchy at finer scales, agricultural landscapes usually more patchy at larger scales, while patchiness in urban landscapes may vary, depending on whether you are talking about an industrial, suburban residential or inner-city business district. The relevance of this to your study should be clarified here.Line 248: Do you mean that you detected patterns of correlation with socio-economic variability in your analyses? This wasn&#8217;t clear from your results.Lines 281-283: What about orchard trees (e.g. some of the crops in your study landscape), many of which mass flower before they produce leaves? Would this over/under estimate high or low EVI/NDVI?Line 286-293: I think this is a really important point and needs a bit more explanation. Restoration of ecosystems within managed landscapes should incorporate peripheral effects arising from differences in management and phenology compared to unmanaged ecosystems. How do your results inform this approach?             Comments:This is an interesting study that takes a novel approach to understanding how landscape-scale shifts in phenology influence pollinator abundance. Using remote sensing data to explore relationships between biodiversity and vegetation is a relatively new method and has rarely been used to study pollinator communities. In particular, understanding how pollinator communities are influenced at the landscape-scale by managed land uses (e.g. mass-flowering crops or urban areas) is an important ecological question &#8211; using remote sensing to explore the abrupt spatial and temporal changes in floral resource availability that arise between natural and agricultural or urban land uses is an interesting way to approach this question. I have some queries about Methods and a few minor suggestions for edits related to clarity of expression and the need for more detail in some parts (see detailed comments).                                                ", "This manuscript investigates how vegetation phenology varies in a human-altered California grassland landscape, and whether or not these changes in phenology correlate with those of the bee community that depends on floral resources.The writing is clear enough, however the manuscript contains a number of spelling and grammatical errors which should be carefully revised before acceptance. Furthermore, Figures could benefit from a more detailed legend to make them more accessible. The time stamps in Figure 1 are hard to read, as are the lines in Figure 2, which makes them difficult to interpret. Figure 4 appears to include trendlines for the different land types, however there seems to be no explanation in the Figure legend or any values which describe the strength of the effect, it may be helpful to put these directly in the Figure.The raw data of the NDVI and EVI data appears to be available online (Reference 1), and the bee community data will be uploaded to the Dryad data depository (but does not appear to be publicly available yet).                 Overall the question is interesting and the approach of using remote sensing techniques, including multi seasonal variation in phenology, could help estimating biodiversity for other taxa beyond bees. The question is clearly defined and meaningful.The study appears to be appropriately designed and executed, showing major differences in land surface phenology and bee community distributions between urban, agricultural, and natural land use types. Methods are sufficiently described and research has been conducted in conformity with prevailing ethical standards.                 The dataset appears to be sufficiently large enough to answer the research question, however since each of the sites were sampled multiple times, I wonder though if a repeated measures approach could be more appropriate for the analysis as data points of the same sampling location may not be independent.A potential shortcoming is the limited resolution of the remote sensing technology, which has been apropriately acknowledged in the manuscript. It would be great to see GPS coordinates of the actual sampling sites.

"], "10.7717/peerj.5944": ["Line 110-116 In this sentence the authors claim that it is possible that dogs do not turn to humans to seek assistance with a problem solving task, but rather as a result of lack of persistence and that there is nothing else for the dog or wolf to do. Can they not also choose to explore the room/enclosure or simply do nothing? Persson et al. 2015 did a principal component analysis including both human-directed behaviours as well as task interactions. They showed that there was no correlation between task interactions and human interactions. If the dogs turned to the human as a result of lack of persistence, this would have shown as a negative correlation in the principal component loadings.Line 163-164 &#8220;Based on literature, we predicted a positive correlation between persistence and behavioural variety.&#8221; ; it would be helpful if the authors could add a few of those literature references here. Line 168 &#8220;subjects that show an unsure body posture&#8221; ; do the authors mean insecure body posture? Or do they mean that they are unsure about the body posture displayed by the individual? I think this needs clarification or perhaps just a change of word choice.The authors write &#8220;based on literature&#8221; or similar on line 163, 172 and 175; I suggest that they re-phrase some of these sentences to make it easier and nicer to read.Line 178-180 &#8211; I like that they summarise their aims in the end of the introduction. Very helpful!Materials and methodsThe authors do not mention the breed/s of the dogs. They refer to another study where there is a more thorough description of the animals. However, I believe that this manuscript would benefit of a bit more information about the animals such as breed, handling, social experiences etc. Have both of their species been subjects of the same studies previously e.i. could they have different experiences from previous studies possibly affecting problem-solving behaviour? There is quite a large age difference between the dogs and the wolves of this study. This should be addressed and the implications discussed in the discussion section.The authors use a lot of &#8220;we&#8221; e.g. &#8220;we tested&#8221;, &#8220;we placed&#8221; etc. throughout the entire materials and methods section. Hence, I believe that some re-phrasing to remove some of the &#8220;we&#8221; will improve the text in this section. Example: they write on line 212 &#8220;We mounted a smartphone..&#8221; , instead they could write &#8220; A smartphone was mounted..&#8221; or similarly.Line 240 I cannot find this supplementary video among the reviewing material.Line 242 I suppose it should read &#8220;first contact with the object&#8221; and not &#8220;First contact object&#8221;?Line 242 change &#8220;Defined&#8221; to &#8220;defined&#8221; with a small d.ResultsLine 322, 324-235, 338 etc and in Table 3 as well as in the text of the results section (perhaps also in other places) the authors write &#8220;unsure&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;confident&#8221;. I believe they are referring to the &#8220;insecure&#8221; body-posture of table 2? This should be changed so that they consistently stick with the same term. I personally think that &#8220;insecure&#8221; is preferable in this case.DiscussionAs previously mentioned, some discussion about the age difference and effects of age on problem solving behaviour should be added to this section.Line 434-435 add a &#8220;to&#8221; &#8220;may help to better understand&#8221;Table 1I think this table would look better if you removed the horizontal line except for the header row. You could probably remove the vertical lines as well and make the headers and columns centered except for the first column. Table 2I think the design of this table can be improved, see comment on table1Table 3I think the design of this table can be improved, see comment on table1 e.g. remove the lines among the values but keep header lines and first column vertical line.Figure 3One of the labels read &#8220;unsure&#8221;, does this refer to insecure?Figure 4Looks good!Figure 5Looks good!                 The dogs have a mean age of 4 years while the wolves had a mean age of 6.3 years. By looking at the age presented in table 1 you can see that there is a great variation where there are several dogs at the age of 2 years and several wolves at the age of 8 years. This could have effects on your data. There are studies showing that age affects boldness and explorative behaviours in dogs e.g. Starling MJ, Branson N, Thomson PC, McGreevy PD (2013) Age, sex and reproductive status affect boldness in dogs. Vet J197: 868&#8211;872.Siwak CT (2001) Effect ofage and level of cognitive function on spontaneous and exploratory behaviors in the beagle dog. Learn Mem 8: 317&#8211;325.I cannot see that the authors have included age in their models. Did they correct for age in any other way? Otherwise, this needs to be done.The authors seems to have controlled for hunger and/or food motivation in the individuals by testing them at roughly the same time of day and by not feeding them in the evening prior to testing. Even so, could it not be the case that what is tested is not really task persistence but rather food motivation or willingness to work for food. Could it be the case that the wolves in this case, found the bait more favorable than the dogs? Could this be controlled for in any way? Or, at least, it should be discussed in the discussion section.                 no comment             Comments:In this study, the authors have investigated the difference in problem-task persistence in socialised dogs and wolves raised under similar conditions. This is important since it can give an alternative explanation to why dogs and wolves differ in their problem solving behaviour where dogs are typically less persistent and instead choose to interact with a nearby human. The authors have used a unique setup of both dogs and wolves with similar experiences of human contact resulting in a very interesting study. Generally the manuscript is well written and constructed and the findings are meaningful.                                                ", "In general, the manuscript is well-written but there are some sections that need to be rewritten for clarification. I have included several comments into my corrected pdf file.The literature is well covered but see some of my comments for improvement.It seems that one animal has been removed from the raw data (.xlsx file). See my comment. This might explain why I was not able to replicate some of their results using the same analyses.I am not certain all figures should be included. For instance, fig 3 is not easy to read. Please remove or modify.                 The experimental design is well thought and original. Excluding humans from the equation to determine whether dogs and wolves differ is very clever (I should have figured it out myself...). However, I have some problems to link the notions of persistence and flexibility to this latter. I see these questions as an afterthought. For myself, I would have preferred that the authors had focused on testing the difference between both species first, and then, had examined the factors that could contribute to the differences, if dogs and wolves differ. The way the manuscript is written, the factors that could explain why dogs and wolves differ are examined first before testing the difference between dogs and wolves and this is not in link with the premium questions asked by the authors.I would appreciate if more details were provided when describing the different behaviours measured by the authors and why they selected these particular behaviours. Also, as mentioned in my comments, I wonder if the behaviours were mutually exclusive one from each other. See lick and touch/lick as an example.                 Having access to the dataset, I have attempted to replicate some of the results presented by the authors. Overall, I was not able to replicate the analyses.1) I suggest to remove the two-steps cluster analysis. As described in my R file, this type of analysis is justified when the number of observations (participants) is over 200 (see attached article). In the current study, there were 27 participants. And the analysis was performed on non-normally distributed continuous variables, violating some assumptions for this test. And some variables were discrete (not continuous - as requested by a multivariate approach), with some variables having 2 possibles values. Finally, I think that a discriminant analysis would have been more useful for finding the variables that can be used to discriminate dogs and wolves. It seems to me that the two-steps cluster analysis did not answer the main question asked by the authors but it was rather used to explore the \"concepts\" that could be used to discriminate dogs and wolves. Just for fun, I have used R to run a two-steps cluster analysis (see R file). I was not able to replicate their results (not surprising with these variables and a small number of participants).2) I don't understand the rational for selecting some variables in the analyses and excluding some others. Please be transparent here. See attached pdf file.3) Some variables are discrete (e.g. behavioural variety) but appeared to be treated as continuous. These variables should be fitted using a discrete probability mass function (e.g. binomial) and not a continuous density function. Some variables (e.g. approach posture or likelihood of manipulation) are discrete. But nowhere the authors explained how they have treated them and how they were integrated into the models (e.g. for the cluster analysis).4) I was pleased to see the use of generalized additive models for location, scale and shape. However, a better justification must be provided relative to the different distributions used to fit the data. Sometimes, instead of \"playing\" around with the different distributions and find the one that fit the best the data, one has to rethink about how his/her data were collected and sometimes the best option is to regroup the data or split them. Otherwise, one can face the problem of overfitting his/her data (using too much parameters).5) Sometimes, the authors analyzed separately the two species and sometimes, they  were compared within the same analysis. There is no consistency between the different analyses.6) I was not able to replicate the Fisher test results... See my R file.7) The rational for using some variables in different models is not presented.8) The rational for scaling the subjects' persistence and contact latency is not provided.9) What were the contrasts (post-hoc tests) used following the GAMLSS models?10) I don't think that the variable \"behavioural variety\" is valid. My point is that some animals produced the same behaviour many many times and some animals produced the same behaviour only once. But when compiled for the behavioural variety variable, both animals were given the same score (1).11) I did not read section 4 (Results) because of all my concerns presented above.12) I did not read the conclusion as well.

The authors should map their RNAseq reads back to the final assembly to get a rough estimate on the expression level of the assembled transcripts.

To be on the safe side, the authors should use only SNPs that are in common between different pipelines. 6\tMore generally, a considerable fraction of the predicted &#8220;SNPs&#8221; are nucleotide polymorphisms between orthologous regions in the parental haplotypes of a heterozygous individual, but probably alignment artifacts caused by misalignment The exact rate is difficult to determine.

Finally, I&#8217;m a little concerned that measuring fresh weight is not the same as measuring dry biomass, as fresh weight can be dependent on water content at the time of weighing. Can the authors alleviate this major concern in some way, such as weighing adult beetles reared on different species, or discussing these limitations in the paper?

These limitations should be mentioned as a caveat somewhere in the discussion&#8226;\tPerhaps the authors can expand upon the potential implications of the research a little more. The whole host-race or genotype point is particularly interesting and worthy of further discussion; other species (e.g., Phragmites australis) have shown similar patterns of having invasive and non-invasive genotypes             Comments:This interesting study addresses mechanisms underlying invasion success of Costelytra zealandica, a native beetle species which spread extensively and became a pest following the introduction of exotic crop species such as ryegrass and clover. The authors collected third instar larvae of C. zealandica and C. brunneum from areas of native or exotic plants from four field sites to conduct two experiments: 1) an olfactometer choice test (silver tussock, white clover, control, no choice), and 2) a fitness experiment where C. zealandica from native and exotic sites was fed roots of either its native or exotic host species. In the olfactometer experiment, the authors found that C. zealandica collected from exotic pasture showed a preference for the tube containing the exotic species, whereas C. zealandica and C. brunneum collected from under native plants showed no preference for either native or exotic plants. The second experiment showed that larvae collected from exotic pasture survived and performed better when fed white clover roots than roots of native silver tussock, whereas larvae collected from native sites demonstrated no difference in larval weight increase when fed native or exotic plant roots. These results indicate that there may be distinct host-races of C. zealandica which prefer and perform more strongly on exotic crops, underlying why the species has become invasive on these crops.Overall, I like the paper. It is clear that a lot of time and hard work has gone into collecting the beetle larvae and running the experiments, which I certainly appreciate. Furthermore, I believe the study is scientifically sound, reasonably well-written, and falls under the broad scope of the journal. Indeed, the use of a native species as an invader alongside a closely-related benign native species is an excellent phylogenetic control, as well as adding to the currently small body of literature on native invaders. Furthermore, evidence for distinct host-races of C. zealandica is an interesting and important result and so should be published. However, I do have a few issues with certain parts of the paper, particularly with completeness of data and results, the statistical approach, and some issues with experimental design (see specific comments).

There are some odd usages in the text (especially the title) and a couple of typographic errors (e.g. extra word in line 86, use of hyphens in line98) but overall it is sound.  I don&#8217;t think the use of the word &#8220;fond&#8221; in the title is appropriate, it is too anthropomorphic. I think it should be changed.I found the pie charts in Figure 2 to be confusing. I feel it would be more useful to present these as stacked bar graphs. They statistics attached to those figures are also too precise. I think Figs 3 and 4 may also need to be modified to accommodate a different analysis.                 The choice experiments are interesting and the use of the 3-armed olfactometer for these experiments seems to be similar enough to how larvae find food in the field.  Are larvae normally found together? The decision to use groups of 5 larvae in the trials needs to be justified as the patterns observed may also be a function of a single larva&#8217;s choice rather than each individual choosing the ultimate host.Some of the analyses could be improved. Could survivorship curves with Meir-Kaplan analyses be performed with the data obtained? That would be more informative than just using the final mortality rates.The analysis of the feeding trials should also be improved. Using the raw mass gain isn&#8217;t really appropriate to compare performance on the different diets, it would be better to use something like ANCOVA using initial size as a covariate.                 The data collected are interesting but the statistics used to analyse them are not the best options for these data.  The work still seems to show that the two species have a different affinity for different host plants and how this is reflected in host choice and use.  The speculation on host race bit seems a bit out of place here but is grounded in the paper (and the work associated with it) so it&#8217;s reasonable to include it.             Comments:This is a really interesting system and the questions raised in the paper are of broad significance to a number of biologists. It&#8217;s difficult to put the host shifts in the context of how the two species use different hosts naturally, as little is known of the their breadth in unmodified environments (short of the comments in line 73) and this is something that would really advance the questions raised here. I think the work would be made much better with some reanalyses and some rejigging of how the data are presented.                                                ", "No Comments                 The experimental design is appropriate for the stated objectives.  It might have been more appropriate to make the comparison between C. zealandica populations feeding on native and exotic plant species if they had chosen individuals feeding on ryegrass as an exotic instead of white clover.  In that way they would be comparing fitness of the populations on a native grass and an exotic grass rather than between a grass and a legume with all the attendant symbiotic associations that could affect the results.                 The conclusions leave out a possible alternative explanation that should be addressed.  That is, it may be possible that the authors are dealing with two different cryptic species when comparing individuals from two different populations.  I am not necessarily suggesting that they conduct a genetic analysis, but I do think they need to address this possibility, particularly since they do raise the issue of the exotic plants being a selective force in the potential fitness of the herbivore.

The expression of proinflammatory cytokines has been reduced along with hBD-2 which is not good in terms of bacterial killing.

Comments:Mulberry is an important economically plant which has a very wide distribution range in world, especially in China. In this manuscript, the authors investigate the function of EIN3/EIL, the key component involve in ethylene signal transduction, in response to abiotic stresses in non-model plant mulberry. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis, the authors found that expression levels of MnEIL3 were significantly upregulated in roots and shoot in response to salt and drought stress. Meanwhile, overexpression of this gene in Arabidopsis enhanced plant&#8217;s tolerance to salt stresses and showed better ability to survive from drought stress after re-watering. Further, authors tested the influence of MnEIL3 on the transcription of four downstream ethylene biosynthetic genes and showed that MnEIL3 significantly enhanced the activities of two promotors. Based on their experimental results, a working model of mulberry MnEIL3 in response to abiotic stress was proposed.This manuscript is well organized and well written. The authors familiar with the background and progress in the field. Characterization of the function of MnEIL3 in abiotic stresses tolerance and ethylene biosynthetic genes expression will provide new clues for the community. I am in favor of this study being published in PeerJ after the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; be revised by adding the comparison of the function of EIL3/EIL in response to abiotic stresses in model plants and non-model plants. Is there any difference? Another suggestion is revision of the title.

It would be better if the authors can mention in Introduction that ein3-1 and eil1-1 are ethylene-insensitive mutants. Moreover, to remain consistent, &#8220;ein3 eil1 Arabidopsis&#8221; should be referred to as &#8220;ein3-1 eil1-1 Arabidopsis&#8221;.  As for figure legends, the authors should add what significance levels letters &#8220;a&#8221;, &#8220;b&#8221; and &#8220;c&#8221; refer to in Fig.1.                 Sufficient details were provided in the Materials and Methods section as well as supplementary materials to allow for replication. It would be nice if the authors can explain the rationale as for why MnEIL3 was chosen as the focus of the study, not MnEIL1 or MnEIL2. The fact that MnEIL1/2 were able to modulate the activities of MnACO/MnACS promoters as demonstrated in the strawberry transient analysis is a sign that MnEIL1/2 could also play important roles in ethylene signal transduction.  If this is the case, it will be more informative if the authors can evaluate the expression profiles of MnEIL1/2 in response to salt/drought stresses.                 In general, the data presented in this manuscript are robust with experimental replicates and supported the points the authors tried to make. One minor issue with Fig.3, the error bar was not clear for AtACS3. Were the numbers too tight to produce error bars or not enough replicates existed? In the Results section, although the authors stated that &#8220;the activities of MnACS1 and MnACS3 promoters were regulated by salt and drought stresses&#8221;, it was not clear from Fig. S3 how the MnACS1 promoter showed responses to abiotic stresses. Therefore it will be helpful if the authors can elaborate in the Results section how MnACS1 was regulated by abiotic stresses.             Comments:1. The authors showed enhanced expression of AtACS/ACO genes in MnEIL3ox Arabidopsis as well as increased activities of MnACS promoters in Arabidopsis induced by salt/drought stresses. If possible, it will be better to measure the MnACS/ACO expression levels in Mulberry and see how they change upon salt/drought stresses.2. In Fig.1, the MnEIL3 expression showed no significant differences at selected time points compared to no treatment. It will be nice if the authors can provide some hypothesis/speculations in the Discussion section as for why this might be the case. Or were similar time-dependent profiles previously observed in model plants for EIN3/EILs genes?                                                ", "This manuscript of Liu et al. describes the effects of the MnEIL3 gene on salt tolerance and drought stresses in Morus notabilis. They analyzed the role of MnEIL3 by heterologous overexpression in Arabidopsis by measuring resistance to salt and drought stress and induction of ethylene biosynthesis genes.The data provided in the manuscript are interesting, but unfortunately, the results presented are not sufficiently precise and rigorous to be accepted as is.A native English speaker must revise the English language of this article. The introduction of the manuscript is clear and the working hypothesis and objectives clearly exposed. However, there is an overall bias in the paper with no mention of occidental researches that are at the origin of the major discoveries on the ethylene biosynthesis and signalling pathways.  Despite the fact that this work is impressive, the presentation of the work lacks precision and consistency in its formal construction.There is confusion for an uninitiated person between Morus alba L. (line 86) and Morus notabilis Schneid (line 106). Are alba and notabilis the same specie? Are they different species? Why are genes noted with MnEIL3 instead of MaEIL3? Can the authors present the genus Morus more clearly for an uninitiated reader? Which genus Morus model species have been already sequenced?Throughout the article several acronyms are not defined: TFs, SIEDS, AP2, ESE1, CBFs, ARR, XTH33, LSUI, PERE, ECBS, ...Finally, some major results are presented in the additional data. However, they are cited in the result section as major results. Why are not they integrated directly into the result section? There is therefore a major problem of coherence in the construction of the manuscript( ex: line 195-222). There is an absence of homogeneity in the references: ex: line 430-435                 This paper answers to the aim and scope of the journal.However, the material and methods section suffers from a lack of precision. For example, there is no mention of the number of technical and biological replicates performed during PCRs and housekeeping genes used as control. How the calculations are made? Similarly, in the section statistical analysis, the nonparametric or parametric tests used are not indicated: T-test, Kruskal-Wallis, Mood's median test, ANOVA, ... nor the number of repetitions used.I have a personal problem of understanding this study in relation to the induction of salt and water stresses that are never done on plants of the same age and in the same way. In my opinion the results are therefore difficult to compare. For example, in material and method section, see the different ways to get water stress: line 109 line 112 line 137 line 141. How the authors can justify these differences in the plant treatment? Furthermore, Figure 2 that is supposed to show the effects of salt and water stresses is very poor scientifically. There is no serious quantified evaluation. Why did the authors not quantify the results of drought stress resistance by measuring the changes of proline and ABA concentrations, water loss of detached leaves, stomatal conductances, transpiration rate,...(see for ex: Yu, H., et al. Plant Cell 2008; 20:1134-1151)?                 As mentioned earlier, the work lacks quantified results of the effects of water stress and drought on the transformed plants. This seriously affects the strength of the conclusions and the hypothetic model based solely on the expression data.It is imperative that the PCR data be better explained (number of biological and / or technical repeats, control housekeeping genes, calculations...) and the statistics used indicated.             Comments:In conclusion, the publication cannot be reasonably accepted in this state without being rewritten and without additional data to better quantify at physiological level the effects of salt and water stresses in arabidopsis and Morus notabilis.

However, often the references in the Introduction do not cite the most up-to-date publications. For example, the reference to Shapiro, Skinner and Kessler (1984) on line 63 could be replaced with a paper by Burgess and colleagues which makes the same point, but is specific to the Australian population, and was published more recently (Burgess, P.

The paragraph beginning on line 72 seems to be quite important to the paper&#8217;s premise, but is disjointed and seems to skim over previously found sex differences in other studies. It may be worthwhile expanding on the findings of the Holzinger et al (2012) review, as it seems to pertain more to adult populations and discusses results that are relevant to the attitudes asked about in this study (e.g. reactions to people with mental illnesses). The importance of the study and the hypotheses are well written, although the sentence &#8220;High mental health literacy&#8230;[may] potentially decrease an individual&#8217;s vulnerability to suicide&#8221; needs a reference. The Results and Discussion sections are well summarised. In the Results section, however, Figures 3, 4 and 5 seem unnecessary, as these results are reported in-text as percentage values (lines 194-213); readers do not need to see the number of participants who gave each answer if they already know the percentage values. The reference on line 404 of the References section is not mentioned in the text of the paper.                 The research question and hypotheses are well defined. However, the Materials and Methods section requires substantial clarification:&#8226;\tThe paragraph beginning on line 107 explains how participants were recruited but not how they received the survey. Was the survey linked into the advertisements or were participants emailed the link after expressing their interest, for example?&#8226;\tIn the Materials and Procedures section:o\tHow many participants received each vignette?o\tWhat type of anxiety disorder was presented in the anxiety vignette?o\tWas the sex of the character in the vignette also randomised?o\tHow long did the survey take participants to complete?o\tThe survey questions need to be described in more detail (lines 127-137). Lines 127-8 state that &#8220;a series of questions&#8230;were created to ascertain various aspects of their mental health literacy...(i.e., &#8220;In five words or less, what would you say, if anything, is wrong with the individual in the vignette?&#8221;) Was this the only question they were asked? If so, the sentence might read better as &#8220;Participants were first asked to identify the disorder presented in the vignette. Additional questions were designed to ascertain&#8230;&#8221; Each of the questions which have results mentioned in the Results section need to be described in the Methods section; the questions relating to the vignette character&#8217;s need for treatment or risk of self-harm are not mentioned at all, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand the references to these variables in Tables 1 and 2. o\tThe format of each question should be outlined as well, e.g. participants were asked to rate the seriousness of the problem (lines 131-2), but the rating scale used is not described. Similarly, lines 135-7 do not mention whether the questions relating to sex perceptions were forced choice, open ended, rated on a scale, or otherwise; Figures 3, 4 and 5 imply that the questions were forced choice, but this should be clarified.o\tDoes the paragraph describing correct and incorrect responses (beginning on line 138) relate only to the recognition of disorder question, or did these criteria apply to other questions in the survey? What were the criteria used to determine accurate perceptions of sex susceptibility?                 The Discussion section could benefit from additional references which support the points made by the authors when explaining their results, e.g. line 232-3 &#8220;depression is&#8230;associated with fewer and milder social stigmas&#8221; is not referenced. The following reference may also be of use in understanding why depression is better recognised than other mental illnesses: Jorm, A. F., Christensen, H., &amp; Griffiths, K. M. (2005). The impact of beyondblue: the national depression initiative on the Australian public's recognition of depression and beliefs about treatments. Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 39(4), 248-254. The paragraphs beginning on lines 248 and 253 could be joined, as they seem to discuss the same finding. The Discussion would also benefit from a clearer explanation of what this study adds to the literature on sex differences in mental health literacy in the Australian public and a brief comment on the strengths of the study. The concluding sentence (lines 322-325) introduces new information into the manuscript; it might instead be better placed earlier in the Discussion, with some comments on how the results could inform research and practice, e.g. should education programs targeting mental health literacy in males focus more strongly on information about a specific disorder, how to help someone correctly identify a mental illness, or on reducing the stigma associated with the belief that people with mental illnesses lack personal control?In the limitations section, the papers referred to as the Jorm et al and Link et al citations on lines 295-96 do not show that males are less likely than females to participate in mental health literacy research; both studies involved nationally representative samples, so rates of participation would have been equivalent to population demographics, and neither discuss how often males refused to participate compared to females. On lines 313-4, &#8220;exploration of the possible reasons behind participants&#8217; mental health literacy&#8221; requires further explanation; it is not clear what this means. Similarly, the difference between &#8220;youths&#8221; and &#8220;adolescents&#8221; is unclear on line 315. It may be worthwhile mentioning that while there are published studies that compare the mental health literacy of different age groups within the adult and adolescent categories (e.g. Farrer, L., Leach, L., Griffiths, K. M., Christensen, H., &amp; Jorm, A. F. (2008). Age differences in mental health literacy. BMC Public Health, 8(125). doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-8-125; Yap, M. B. H., Wright, A., &amp; Jorm, A. F. (2011).

Comments:It would be helpful to the reader if the expression was tidied to improve clarity, e.g. instead of &#8220;a male protagonist vignette&#8221; (lines 263, 265-266, and elsewhere in the Discussion), try &#8220;a vignette with a male protagonist&#8221; or &#8220;the John vignette&#8221;; in line 93, &#8220;the hypotheses proposed to be explored by the present research are as follows&#8221; could simply read &#8220;the study&#8217;s hypotheses are as follows&#8221;; the concluding sentence (lines 322-325) states that there are &#8220;numerous areas of public mental health literacy that may be improved,&#8221; but only offers one example of this.

Hence, it would seem more relevant to report findings in relation to such an examination (i.e., findings in relation to perceptions of need for treatment among males and females for the three disorders) than the overall gender differences observed.   Introduction 4)\tI feel that the flow and structure of the introduction could be improved to provide a stronger rationale for the hypotheses. -\tFor example, findings regarding recognition of disorders are presented at two points in the introduction (lines 41-44 and 63-71).

Furthermore, if this was the only aim of the study, the first hypothesis is not relevant to this aim.2)\tAs mentioned in the previous section, when reading the second hypothesis it seems that examination of sex differences in mental health literacy was being done separately for the three disorders. However, some of the analyses do not reflect this. Consider whether such analyses would be suitable (in light of the low number of male participants and issues relating to the power of the analyses) or whether it is necessary to re-formulate this hypothesis.  This issue is relevant for the third hypothesis as well.3)\tConsider if it would be better to reformulate the hypotheses as aims. The hypotheses lack specificity when there is use of terms such as &#8220;various aspects&#8221;.

Or would this be relevant to yet another hypothesis? 3)\tLines 191-201- consider presenting the Chi square statistics for sex susceptibility for each of the disorders separately. It seems that a majority of the population do not perceive differences in sex susceptibility in relation to each of the disorders.

A similar analysis in relation to the other examinations done for sex susceptibility would be useful. 4)\tLines 207-213- it would be helpful to provide a rationale for this examination. As the question regarding sex susceptibility is directly asking about which sex is more vulnerable to the disorder, there might be no association between the participant&#8217;s response and sex of the protagonist. Hence, this type of examination might be more relevant to an examination of methodological issues and how naming a particular sex in the vignette can affect participant responses.

Comments:Introduction- The authors performed a detailed description of micro-CT method for studying animal anatomy (including advantages of the method, the use of contrast agents for the visualization of soft tissue, measurement of morphological features, and which protocol to follow depending on the sample type). However, I think it would be important to highlight in the Introduction section some relevant aspects of studying the wing myology in the sparrowhawk (although some are mentioned in the discussion), such as: 1- the available information of forelimbs muscles of Accipitriformes is scare in the literature, and this is the first work dealing with the wing muscles of Accipiter nisus; 2- works using contrast-enhanced micro-CT in birds are few and none focus on the forelimbs; and 3- this study provides a base information for other studies (e.g. finite element analysis, geometric morphometrics, among others) that will allow functional inferences in locomotion and hunting modes. - I am not sure that the sparrowhawk can be defined as a model species. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that this species can be considered particularly as representative of birds of prey (or birds of similar size), because the size of the wings is extremely variable within birds and, therefore, the protocol would also be variable.Methods- Please clarify the source of osteological and myological nomenclature. Usually for Aves is followed by Baumel et al. (1993). Handbook of Avian Anatomy.- The reconstruction of the 3D model was performed from the CT images by scans of the stained wing on day 26 or by a combination of the scans of the different regions (brachial arm, antebrachial arm and hand) from days 4 to 26?. Please clarify it. - In this section it should be mentioned that a regression analysis for the wing muscles volumes of the fresh wing and 3D model is done, and the software used to do it.Results- I think the following sentences are more appropriate to include in the Discussion section:Lines 175-177: &#8220;Since tendon morphology can be an important component of biomechanical analysis this (the iodine low affinity for ligaments and tendons) is potentially an important consideration (Sellers et al., 2010)&#8221;. This sentence can be added to the line 211 and above.Lines 179-181: &#8220;This clearly illustrates the value of this technique for reconstructing the 3D shape of the individual muscles and their anatomical relations which can be essential for biomechanical models (Sellers et al., 2013)&#8221;. This sentence can be included to the line 241 and above.Lines 187-189: &#8220;This result (those from the regression analysis) validates the use of 3D imaging techniques for obtaining quantitative data of muscle architecture although the slope shows that there is appreciable shrinkage (~33%), which needs to be taken into consideration to obtain useful quantitative data&#8221;.  This sentence can be added to the line 245 and above.- Also a table with comparisons of muscle volumes of the fresh wing and 3D model may be useful for future studies and would be appreciated.Conclusions- Replace &#8220;By using a low concentration of an iodine-based buffered formalin solution for a two-week staining period, it was possible to visualise and identify all the individual muscles of the bird wing&#8221; with &#8220;By using a low concentration of an iodine-based buffered formalin solution for a two-week staining period, it was possible to visualise and identify all the individual muscles of the sparrowhawk wing&#8221;. It seems more appropriate due to the variable size of the wings within birds and the consequent possible adjustments in the protocol (see above).Minor points- Please use \"e.g.\" in roman type or in italic type throughout the text.- In Methods section says that the scans were taken on days 4, 11, 16, 19 and 26, but in the Results and Discussion sections and in the Figures 1 and 2 says 3, 10, 15, 18 and 25 days. Make sure to homogenize the days throughout the manuscript.- In Introduction section, line 85, de Crespigny et al. (2008) is cited as an example where muscle volume can be measured with the iodine-based contrast-enhanced &#956;CT technique, when in fact the article mentions the possibility of making accurate measurements of brain morphometric parameters such as volume (but not specifically of muscles).- Replace the heading &#8220;Methods&#8221; with &#8220;Materials and Methods&#8221; conforms to PeerJ standards.- In References section, Gignac et al.

You never actually make use of a comparison against #1 - what was the point of dissecting the stained specimen by hand?

The equations lists in the manuscript seem to be correct but not easy to follow, detailed mathematical annotations are encouraged to be included.                 2) The purposed method VoomDLDA/VoomDQDA or VoomNSC didn't show superior performance compared to conventional approaches, in both simulation (Fig3) and real data.

The authors utilize both simulated and real datasets and compare their results with some of the commonly used classification methods.I commend the authors for making their source code available. The method is also made available via a web service.I do not have any major concerns. I have listed the following points which would improve the publication:* In the abstract, keep background info to a minimum (RNAseq advantages not necessary to list in abstract) and highligh the contributions more.* The authors call their method voomNSC in the abstract, but voomDDA in the web link and the title. Use one name for the method, consistently. What does voomDDA stand for? If voomDDA is the umbrella term, the abstract should explain that rather than just voomNSC.* Expand the Voom acronym in the abstract (\"variance modeling at the observational level\")* In intro, authors introduce Voom as a good recently developed method and list its advantages. But a motivation for extending Voom is missing. What does Voom not handle that this paper is addressing?* SVM seems to perform well, but the main criticism of the authors is its inability to produce sparse models. SVM is frequently applied in combination with a feature selection strategy (e.g., forward selection or backward elimination). Performing SVM without feature selection is an unfair comparison.* In Equation 1: what is X.i ?* In Tables, mark the winners in bold.* Include other classifiers (e.g., SVM) also in the webtool.* Network analysis and GO analysis may not be appropriate for the selected classifier genes. Sparse set of genes that are good for classification would mask other coregulated and functionally relevant genes that are necessary for meaningful downstream analysis.* The web address in pdf is hyperlinked to \"http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/voomDDA/.%20\". The extra .%20 causes problems.* Heatmap, Network, and Go features seem to require the user having to run VoomDDA analysis first.

Although the specimen was originally identified as belonging to Ichthyosaurus communis (one of the most common attribution for Jurassic ichthyosaur specimens found in Great Britain), Lomax and coauthors performed a great deconstructionist study to investigate the identity of this specimen, making it scientifically valuable and available to the community.Lomax and colleagues traced down the original locality, constraining the stratigraphic contest and age of the specimen, described the anatomy in detail with the aid of non-invasive 3D imaging reconstruction, and reviewed its original taxonomic attribution. Considering that many Early Jurassic ichthyosaur specimens are often preserved in 2D, this specimen represents a rare opportunity to cast some additional light into the inner soft anatomy, particularly of the skull. In this paper, the authors not only describe the osteology of this specimen, but also restore and detail the inner soft anatomy of the brain and other related structures, providing a much useful example for the anatomy of this taxon to ichthyosaur workers. The description they present and the taxonomic attribution are convincing. The study is very well written and acceptable as it is, but I have flagged a few comments in the review pdf (see attached file) that may improve an already worthy to be published study.In particular:Line 40: I would add a citation here: I&#8217;d suggest Fisher et al. 2016. Line 85: Add size information between brackets here: although the authors mention this information further on close to the end of the paper, it is a little bit frustrating mentioning it at first and then not giving away the information. The reader will appreciate more the immediacy, which will also be found more easily by interested readers.Line 159: remove &#8216;and&#8217; and replace it with &#8216;like&#8217;.

I recommend its publication after minor revisionsMinor comments and suggestions: I think that some topics are worthy to be remark and/or certain questions that could be addressed such as: What is the significance of the new anatomical information in a phylogenetic framework? The new information permits to complete the character scoring of the taxon? This will be very useful to determine the phylogenetic location of Protoichthyosaurus. Which is the interpretation of the peculiar vascular system of the snout? Is it similar or not to the one described by Foffa et al. 2014. in pliosaurs?It could also be worthy if the authors can provide more details and/or reference on how the total body length is estimated. Several localities along the United Kingdom (UK) are mentioned throughout the text and there is no map. English fossiliferous localities (particularly southern ones) are worldwide famous so some readers could be family with most of them but not with all of them. The focus of the contribution makes not necessary to include a map but, if localities are mentioned it would be necessary to explain the significance and/or meaning of these information. Maybe the locality references must not only restrict to actual political divisions of the territories but also to geological formations outcropping in more general areas like Southern, center, northern&#8230; England or Scotland, etc.  Maybe the authors could include a reference: &#8220;Sollas (1916) The skull of Ichthyosaurus, Studies in Serial Sections&#8230;&#8221;. This contribution is, as far as I know,  the first study (using different technic, of course) that provides serial sections of the skull of an ichthyosaur.  Finally, I have a minor comments on the taxonomical identification. From the two characters used by the authors to separate the two species of Protoichthyosaurus (maxilla and postorbital morphologies) I think that in the case of the BMT 1955.G35.1 only the maxilla can be used as the postorbital is lost. In any case, if the authors think that the morphology of the maxilla is not enough the specimen could be referred as Protoichthyosaurus sp.                                                                    ", "The authors present a new description of an ichthyosaur specimen and assign it to the taxon _Protoichthyosaurus prostaxalis._ This is well-presented and provides a good description of this material based on CT scans that is of suitable length for the report.I have found some minor issues that are included in this document and the accompanying marked-up PDF, and suggest **moderate revision** of the work before publication. I also think that some further comparison and discussion of the anatomy of this taxon is necessary, particularly in the context of infrequently-preserved palatal elements. I am happy to be identified and contacted further by the authors to clarify any of my comments.The English throughout is correct and used, however, in some case the lack of proper anatomical orientation nomenclature makes the description confusing. I have marked such instances in the accompanying PDF.The introduction and literature review are suitable and reference relevant articles. Structure is appropriate.The figures given are not as high-quality or structured as well as I think they should be. In particular, figs 2 and 4, which are the main references for the description of the anterior skull and jaw, are too small for purpose: these _are_ the main images to point features that are mentioned in the text and thus should be much larger. Even at full screen width on my laptop, they are too small and low-resolution for me to certainly see many features that you mention. This may partially be due to the resolution of the scans, but given the JPEG(?) artefacts I do not think that is the whole case. The 3D PDF provides this information, but without the essential labelling and scaling that the static figures are there to give. Additionally, I find the colour of the premaxillae to be difficult to see on a white background; this should be changed. Perhaps also consider the colouring and its visibility for colour blind people.The RAW data of the complete skull scans in medical CT has been included and matches the segmented images (figs 2, 4) and 3D PDF as expected, but I did not get the scan data for the &#956;CT scans for the braincase elements. These must be made available also.                 Research is original and well-defined, relevant, and meaningful: the new description as some detail to the knowledge of ichthyosaur cranial anatomy.The methods used are well explained, but some more details of the CT scan settings are required for complete reproducibility: particularly exposure length, filtering used. More details are needed on how and why a similar voxel size was used for the braincase elements.                 The results and discussion are well supported, but could benefit from additional comparision with other know material; this is almost entirely lacking apart from the justification for placing in _Protoichthyosaurus prostaxalis._ In particular, fuller comparison against the limited palatal and endocranial material of other ichthyosaurs will be useful as a marker of ichthyosaur evolution, and morphological variation. Examples where some the palate is known include _Ichthyosaurus, Ophthalmosaurus, Platypterygius, Stenopterygius, Sveltonectes_ [McGowan 1973; Moon 2016; Baur 1895; Kear 2005; Fischer2011], which would all make pertinent comparative material.             Comments:# Additional considerations #A few particular language considerations:* Use anatomical orientations where required: e.g. 'lateral' or 'medial' (as relevant) over 'right' or 'left' (l 261); 'laterally' rather than 'outwards' (l 365).* Ensure that directions 'left' or 'right', where used, are used correctly: in some instances it was unclear whether you were referring to left or right or paired elements, or to the left or right side of an element (e.g. description of the premaxilla \\[l 261\\]). More often these should be replaced with 'medial' and 'lateral'.Several elements are described or mentioned as being present, but not given a formal description:* Right nasal (l 299): mentioned as present but not figured.* Postfrontal (l 323): mentioned as present and partially complete, but neither described nor figured.* Supratemporal (l 425): additional figures of the lateral margin to show the additional facets should be included.These elements should be figured to show they are difficult to describe, or should be included more fully.## Maxilla ##Does the maxilla show evidence of the external narial margin on its dorsal surface? This is one of the features of _P. prostaxalis_ described by @Lomax2018, as it would be useful to compare.## Jugal ##The left side, as preserved, shows this it extends anterior to the orbital margin, as marked by the prefrontal, but does not appear t be complete. Additionally, the facets on the lacrimal and maxilla appear to extend anterior to this. Is the extent of the left jugal going to go extensively anterior to the anterior orbital margin or minimal?## Pterygoid ##The comparisons between BMT 1955.G35.1, _Sveltonectes,_ and _Ophthalmosaurus_ (l 390) may need more justification: what are the similarities/differences? bearing in mind that the pterygoids of both this specimen and _Sveltonectes_ are incomplete compared to _Ophthalmosaurus._ The general form seems to be similar in the shape of the quadrate ramus, while only the posterior portion of the palatal ramus is preserved in BMT 1955.G35.1.I can't see the dorsal ramus of the pterygoid clearly in either the figures or the 3D PDF.

I don't know the word limit of the tilte but the journal editor should consider changing the paper's editor to reflect the fact that a single case-study (GPI-hTfR1) is analyzed rather than the general phenomenon of virus-receptor binding. This is needed especially as different case-studies often produce different results. Indeed, the authors well articulate already in the abstract and then in the introduction  the weak spots of the field. In the same line of thought, the case-study differences and the analyzed data is not only b/c of PPI problems. An important paper in the field that caused David Baker to work hard on the problem is http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19561092 where it shown the mutation prediction is good on average but not in each case-study. Actually, the authors may want to refer to this paper in their mutation analysis. Likewise, steered MD was already used for PPI e.g. Cuendet M, Michielin O. 2008 which the authors cite.2. The authors imply that their methodology is new. Yet, steered MD is a common methods and was used also for mutaions e.g. pubmed I (PMID: 23836247 ).

This choice of parameters should be discussed in light of other SMD publications as are the other choices within the SMD protocol. In this discussion, differences should be highlighted and explained.2. in section 3.2 you write: \"For SMD, at the centroid of 176several atoms a force was applied to a single point in GP1.\" Readers should be able to generally repeat the simulation and actually the choice of the atoms to be pulled may affect results. Thus, the list of pulled atoms should be attached as a supp material.

", "The paper is interesting and well written.                 Methods are not enough detailed.Why did the authors use a steering force acting on all alpha carbon instead of the more common choice of either steering just one atom or COM of one of the two counterparts? Are the authors using the protocol introduced by Cuendet and Michielin?If so, this must be clearly stated, otherwise much more details should be reported in the Methods section regarding the steering procedure.Moreover, certain methodological details are reported in the Results (see page 8, rows 176, 177), increasing the difficulty in understanding the steered MD procedure.                 Results are not as relevant as they should be, and the analysis is not sufficiently detailed.1. In the Results, at page 7 (rows 140 to 143), the authors state that large structural rearrangements of an interfacial flexible loop are expected upon binding, and they claim that because of this traditional computational tools are of limited usefulness. While one might agree with this sentence, the authors seem to overlook the fact that such a rearrangement complicate any other simulative strategy as well. How does this loop behave during steered MD simulations?Does it unfolds or it stays in place?A more detailed structural analysis is required.2. As a follow up of the previous point, where are the mutations located relatively to the protein-protein interface?Are they located in the flexible loop? In this case, how do the complexes \"react\" to the mutations?Are there major rearrangements or just local motions during the production runs preceeding the pulling phase?Very basic analysis such as computing the RMSD over time and RMSF per residue should be performed and reported.Moreover, showing the location of these mutations in Figure 1 would improve the comprehension of the manuscript.3. I acknowledge the authors that probing the viability of the approach to point mutations before moving to more challenging cases is a good practice, and I also appreciate the fact that they do not overemphasize their results.However, if I properly understood, the only experimental validation of the protocol is provided by three point mutations which returned two statistically insignificant correct results (N348K, vR111A) and one statistically significant wrong result (Y211T).Unfortunately, this is not enough to support the steered MD protocol.I suggest the authors to enrich the paper in either one of the two following ways:1. by performing a detailed comparative analysis of the interactions and their changes upon mutations along the steereing phase (both from a structural and energetic point of view, e.g. by calculating the interaction energies as reported in the Cuendet and Michielin paper, by monitoring hydrogen bonds braking/formation and so on),OR2. to compare the steered MD results for the three alanine point mutations with more established free energy approaches (FEP or TI, see for example the recent paper by Luitz and Zacharias, Proteins 2013 81:461).             Comments:There are conceptual points that need to be addressed in the current form of the manuscript.1. In the Introduction, at page 1, (rows 14 to 17), the authors state that methods such as FEP and TI rely on a two state model, \"with no intermediate steps\". This is in a best case scenario a misleading sentence, since FEP and TI are computational frameworks that, in order to return meaningful results, in most of cases DO NEED intermediate steps. In fact, the sentence is also misleading since the authors refer to these methods as to \"two state models\" whereas they are generally known as \"pathway methods\" to be easily distinguished by \"endpoint methods\" such as MM-PBSA, LIE, ..., where only ensemble averages of certain endpoint properties are used without intermediate states!This source of confusion must be properly addressed.2. In the Introduction, at page 1 (row 20), the authors refer to the use of steered MD in the prediction of relative binding affinity between wild type and mutant protein-protein complexes as a \"new method\".This is an overrated sentence for two reasons: 1. the authors show a procedure, a protocol (if it was properly detailed), they do not develop any new methods; 2. a similar approach has already been reportedby Cuendet and Michielin as early as 2008, as the authors properly acknowledge in the Results section.The sentence should be tuned down, and this also holds for the sentence at page 11 (rows 266, 267) where the auhtors state that they changed the scope of application of SMD simulations. Minor points.1. Page 1, row 14: probably a typo in: \"...to forgo training.\"2. Page 4, row 71. Is the system size really of about 28,000 atoms? Systems of about 30,000 atoms are relatively small, whereas by looking at Figure 1B I would have expected at least 50,000 atoms. Please double check.3. Page 4, rows 74, 75: \"This was accomplished by setting beta=1.\" What do the authors mean? What does the beta parameter stand for?4. Page 4, row 84. The authors state that the exact input file is reported in the supplement. I wasn't able to find any input file in the supplement, but I apologize beforehand with the authors in case the input file was actually provided.Please double check. Anyway, the authors should at least indicate in the main text very important simulation parameters such as the temperature control method employed and the cutoff radii for nonbonded interactions.5. Page 6, rows 131, 132. Please provide some more details regarding the \"pairwise.t.test function\" and the \"FDR p-value correction\".6. Page 8, row 171. Please avoid odd sentences such as \"we generated a physically realistic simulation world\", as this is what people usually do when performing Molecular Simulations, there is no need for such an emphasys in a scientific paper.7. It seems to me that the authors have a menageable amount of data. Just showing a force profile (Fig. 2) and the maximum force probability distribution (Fig. 3) for selected entries in the main text is ok, but the authors should also show all the force profiles and maximum force probability distributions for all the system they simulated in the supplement.8.

A monotypic genus has been carefully sampled, and five gene regions were analysed to identify a total of  two genera containing eight species in this cryptic species complex.  The methods were rigorous and well explained, showing all possible hypotheses (in Table S2) and using a variety of analytical approaches (lineage testing, barcoding gap identification and K/&#952;) that converge on the eventual solution which is robust and convincing.

Comments:Review: Testing animal-assisted cleaning prior to transplantation incoral reef restorationGeneral comments:  This study is a simple and elegant solution to the problem that fish were dislodging corals from a transplantation site by feeding on biofouling fauna surrounding the nursery grown corals; by allowing the fish to clean the biofouling before transplantation.  The solution to this problem was seemingly very simple and intuitive, but by demonstrating this in a clear experimental framework, this knowledge can be transferred to other projects and to the scientific community.  Reef restoration efforts are rarely accompanied by such clear experimental design, hard data, and useful information.  I am very impressed that this paper will set an example for future restoration work to solve problems not by guesswork, but by data driven experimentation.  The paper has no experimental flaws and overall it is very well written.  I have minor suggestions for making the tone a bit more scientific and slightly less colorful, but other than that I recommend publication with minimal delay.Specific comments:IntroductionLine 47: It should be made clear that the coral gardening concept does not necessarily require rope nurseries (that is just one possible approach).Line 63:  reporting the average and error without the count is not very informative: is this per nursery or per dive?

Line 318:  Last line of the discussion is one of the most important lines in the paper; what closing message do you want to leave with the reader.  I think you might mention in the intro that restoration projects are rarely very data or experimentally driven and that this study is an example how relatively straight forward experiments can provide clear solutions to problems.  You should also add somewhere in the discussion recommendations for future work.  What about the interactions between access by the fish community and coral growth?                                                ", "This is a useful study and the results warrant publication. However, while the manuscript is intelligible, the grammar needs a little work in places. I would suggest this manuscript would benefit from a thorough edit to improve continuity and remove a few pieces of redundant text. For example I would elite the sentence beginning on l68 \"Such support is absent...\" I think the ms would benefit also from some effort to simplify and strive for brevity. The essential message is that following observations that biofouling associated with nursery reared corals attracted fish which increase the risk of post-transplantation dislodgement. Hence the study explored a novel approach to biological management of fouling organisms etc etc                 Straightforward design principles were used, including adequate levels of replication.I feel that there should be more detail provided on the assessment of the post-transplantation dislodgment. The problem as outlined in Figure 1 is apparently resolved after the cleaning station treatment approach is used, but it is difficult to understand  how the dislodgment data was gathered in each case. For example, what was the density of transplantation and when or how frequently post-transplantation was the level of detachment measured.                 The results seem sound and the information of use. Biological control of fouling organisms has been undertaken elsewhere, including with transplanted corals, eg. Omori, 2005,2007, so I would encourage the authors to broaden their exploration of the literature around this topic to place their work into a broader context.Omori M (2005) Success of mass culture of Acropora corals from eggto colony in open water.

Coral Reefs 27(1): 165The authors would likely strengthen the significance of this work if they could assess the cost-benefit of the staged cleaning area approach relative to other protocols for nursery culture and transplantation. Similarly, I feel that the observations on the net-based nursery being more effective that just a rope system unless the rope system is established over a cleaning area supporting diverse fish community should be elaborated on further, as to the pros and cons  or relative costs of both culture systems.             Comments:I think this work is innovative and suggests a few new lines of research worth exploring in the development of more cost effective coral culture. The authors may wish to explore the effect of nursery culture over such cleaning station habitats on smaller coral colonies, as a key bottleneck to coral production remains the high mortality in the first year post-settlement when sexually produced juveniles are cultured.. It would be useful therefore to know if culture from the very smallest sizes of viable fragments in this type of situation would bring improvements                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.6542": ["This article is mostly written in clear, unambiguous, professional English.

The validation of the wild sainfoin populations as well as the verification of sainfoin autoteraploidy is inconsistent between materials and methods, results and discussion and need more attention.A better distinction between di/tri/tetra (etc)-nucleotides and the number of repeats should be made as it gets confusing what the authors mean.The application of the EST-SSRs, once identified, is not clear.

It should be uploaded with the next submission, and must be stored permanently on dryad conditional on acceptance.However, all of these concerns can be addressed relatively easily.                 I believe the research is well executed and suitable for this journal. As said in '1. Basic reporting' it is not repeatable without computer code, but I get the sense of their approach. The investigation is rigorous and honest.                 I believe that the work as stated was well executed. A concern I had is that results were described as significant or insignificant without the use of p-values. I would suggest a different approach (if computationally possible) - that the authors increase their sample size such that differences are apparent without the need to invoke null hypothesis significance testing. If that degree of replication is not feasible, than the authors should provide p-values with their statistical statements. My most pressing concern is the relationship between the motivating question and the results. I describe this below.             Comments:This is an interesting paper. That said I have a significant concern about the framing of this paper with regard to the major motivating hypothesis.1. The authors claim to investigate if differences in the extent of biparental inbreeding associated with alternative incompatibility systems can favor chemical based self-rejection, and claim to reject this hypothesis. However, the simulation does not address this problem. Rather, the authors investigate differences in the genetic load and the extent of biparental inbreeding as a function of alternative self-incompatibility systems, and never directly test their proposed hypothesis. I therefore would like to see the authors ask directly if different modes of self-incompatibility change the extent of autozygosity, allozygosity, and inbreeding depression (the question they asked). The question of selection for this form of self-rejection should be relegated to speculation in the discussion.2. In fact it is not clear what such a test of this hypothesis would be. The authors do not make clear wether they imagine such incompatibility systems replacing one another in natural populations, or if they expect higher level species selection to act. This later hypothesis is often invoked to explain the distribution of plant mating systems (e.g. Goldberg et al 2010). These levels of selection should be clarified in the introduction (lines 34-38). 3. I am somewhat worried about the sensitivity of results to a few somewhat idiosyncratic decisions concerning the nature of the genetic load that was simulated (modest selection for a small number of loci with high mutation rates)  and the expression of this load (individuals with high inbreeding depression take up space in the lattice). I would be curious to see results with more, rarer deleterious recessives with more extreme fitness effects (as we generally assume). I would also be interested to see how early-acting inbreeding depression (such that unfit inbreds did not take up space) would impact the results.4. There are a few (relatively minor) misstatements in the introduction. As the authors' know being that 95% of plants are hermaphrodites does not mean \"that a single plant is capable of self-fertilizing and reproducing without a mating partner,\" but rather that plants have male and female parts. The authors should clarify this for their audience.   I also think that Fisher's automatic advantage could be explained better.  The advantage is that selfers can fertilize themselves and someone else not that they pass a higher fraction of their genes to their offspring (if all pollen that self-fertilized an individual fertilized a different individual instead, fitness would be identical). Another minor point is that heteromorphic incompatibility systems often have genetic based rejections, however, I don't think this would impact the modelling or the results.                                                ", "This manuscript is nicely written, with professional language and clear figures.  Ideas and relevant literature frame the context well (except for the specific concerns noted below).  There are no data to be archived, but the code is available.                 This is a primary research manuscript with a clear motivating question.  Investigation of the question is rigorous (except for the specific concerns noted below).  The code provided and settings described are enough to replicate the research.                 The findings are summarized appropriately.  Conclusions are mostly stated clearly, though some improvements are noted below.  My concerns about the overall biological interpretation are noted below.             Comments:This manuscript is focused on the general question of how different systems of self-incompatibility affect biparental inbreeding.  This is an interesting question to ask for both evolutionary and ecological reasons.  The authors have done an excellent job of clearly and concisely presenting the results from many simulations.  Before this work is published, however, it is essential to clear up some issues about the interpretation of the SI systems and conclusions.(1) My one big concern is about \"heteromorphic SI.\" The model implements a system called PSI, in which selfing is prohibited but there are no additional mating incompatibilities.  This system is useful as a control, in that it does nothing to reduce biparental inbreeding.  However, it bears no resemblance to real heteromorphic SI systems, in which intra-morph matings (not only selfs) are prohibited by an S-locus that is linked to one or more morphological loci.  The authors only admit that PSI is an entirely artificial system near the end (lines 375-378), and the entire introductory framing, as well as much of the discussion, is cast as heteromorphic versus homomorphic SI.  This is extremely confusing and misleading.  Please either completely remove the discussion of heteromorphic SI, or simulate new results using a genetic system that reflects how heteromorphic SI works in nature.(2) My other main concern is about the central conclusion: that homomorphic SI systems do not do much to prevent biparental inbreeding.  For one thing, some of the statements about angiosperm evolution are far too sweeping to be based on this one small simulation study (e.g., lines 27-28, 322-323).  Additionally, I suspect this finding from the model may in part be an artifact of the large number of S-alleles (Table 1).  I think these are at least twice as large as what's known from natural systems, which would greatly reduce the potential to avoid biparental inbreeding.  It would actually be quite interesting to see how the inbreeding avoidance scales with the number of S-alleles, at least a comparison between \"few\" (say, 10) and \"many\" (say, 40).  Alternatively, the rate of generating new S-alleles could be lowered.  Either way, please provide some references to support that the number of S-alleles in the model is biologically realistic.(3)  My remaining comments are much smaller, ordered by appearance rather than importance.throughout: \"biparental\" is more usual than \"bi-parental\"throughout: \"Mating system\" typically refers to the selfing rate rather than the type of SI.  But admittedly the literature is frustratingly inconsistent with this kind of terminology.throughout: SI does not always act in the stigma.  For most or all GSI, it acts in the style.30: Renner (2014) says that 5-6% of species are dioecious, but there are lots of other sexual systems (monoecy, gynodioecy, etc.) besides hermaphroditic.30-31: Just because an individual is hermaphroditic doesn't mean it is capable of uniparental reproduction (e.g., SI).35: The logic of \"consequently\" is not clear.52-54: Using \"haplotype\" here means it isn't correct for sporophytic SI.67-68: Can an empirical citation be provided?81: Purging hasn't been explained.91: It's not clear what \"continuous\" means here.115: \"if they share *only* the same recessive\"129-143: I think of inbreeding as defined at the level of which *individuals* mate with which, so it sounds a bit odd to say that inbreeding is reduced at particular parts of the genome.  Maybe homozygosity would be clearer?148: The statements here are true (but see a comment below), but \"for this reason\" is not their logical connection.158: For isolation by distance, a toroid doesn't seem appropriate.  Better to allow dispersal off the edges?209-211: Why is autozygosity defined by grandparents rather than by parents?  If the latter, it seems like selfing would automatically be separated from biparental inbreeding.  I'm wondering if the current \"proportion autozygous\" results (Fig 3) might be dominanted by selfing, obscuring differences between the SI systems.220-227: This would make more sense if there were some indication of what quantities will be compared.Results: It would help if each subsection began with an indication of what is being checked or what questions are being answered, rather than just jumping into descriptive results.  Lines 259-262 do a good job of this.The Discussion leads off with a small matter that is not the main point and sounds like an artifact.  It would be more effective to start with big questions and perspective.313-314: I don't follow this sentence.  Several generations from when?341, 346, 348, and 148-149: The claim is that there are many S-alleles in a population *because* that's what's necessary for enough compatible matings.  This reads like population-level group selection in the sense that real populations or simulation runs without enough S-alleles preferentially went extinct.  Is this the intent?  Natural SI populations with few S-alleles do exist, e.g., after a bottleneck.373-375: This seems like an extremely aggressive claim with no foundation in logic or data.386-389: SI can also weaken in older flowers simply because proteins denature, rather than because it's a beneficial strategy.Table 1: The s^2 column doesn't seem necessary, or it could at least be placed right next to the sigma column.Figure 1: This is a nice depiction. One small adjustment is that the pollen's inner red circle looks orange (on my screen, at least).

A simple statistical test to test for significance between sites could add a great deal to explaining how/why the environment could shape the diversity observed. In contrast, if the sites are not significantly different, more caution should be made in declaring that the environment shapes diversity. Alternatively, address whether these environmental differences (whether significant or not) are biologically meaningful to the coral/symbiont relationship? Does a 0.95&#176;C difference in temperature make a big difference in the coral/symbiont world?Furthermore, &#8220;Yearly average chl-a concentration values were generally low&#8221; (Line 172 and later in Discussion), but no mention of whether there are apparent differences between sites to consider. Finally, are there available software that could be used in this study to better test for diversity/environmental data associations? The program Geste and R &#8216;vegan&#8217; package come to mind in using generalized linear modeling to investigate whether genetic structure relates to environmental factors. However, I am unsure whether the sample sizes in this study are sufficient or whether sequence data are able to be analyzed by these programs. Worth looking into these and perhaps other options. 5- Why the ITS2 marker was used at all needs additional justification (in addition to Line 277- the end of the paper). Its results are hardly ever mentioned/discussed in the discussion and understandably so; however, it needs to be made more clear why this marker was used in the first place (in Methods), and why the results from psbA noncoding region were the focus of the conclusions and discussion.                 Overall, the findings and conclusions drawn are sound. I appreciate their recognition of the limitations of their study Lines 252-260. As pointed out in this paragraph, host variation could explain Symbiodinium diversity. While they cite cases of mismatch between host and symbiont, they should also reference studies that have found a match suggesting Symbiodinium diversity/distribution is simply due to host-specificity (examples include Bongaerts et al. 2010 [PLoS One], Prada et al. 2014 [Mol Eco]).             Comments:Noda et al. use a faster evolving gene to elucidate the diversity of Symbiodinium within Palythoa tuberculosa in Japan, and combine it with fine-scale environmental data to explore any associations between this diversity and the environment. This work is crucial to the field in joining a few other recent papers that advocate for such a finer-scale approach to better understand the biogeography of Symbiodinium. Overall, the study is sound and robust. The paper is overall well written and this review presents minor comments and revision suggestions.

FAO data for all landings of the species doesn&#8217;t show a substantial decline.  Appears more like catches have been stable since 1990s or perhaps a slight decline.  It&#8217;s probably true that catches have declined substantially in some parts of the Caribbean but if overall catches are stable, then it&#8217;s probably also true that other areas have had increases.

Temperature does vary between the warm and cold seasons but barely.  The fact that any effect was detected with such a small range is surprising for me at least.

The study would have greatly benefited by more advance measures of lobster energy utilisation and storage including metabolic rate and carcass biochemical/energy composition which should be considered in future studies. In the absence of these measurement I suggest that the authors should better speculate on the physiological basis of improved starvation resistance at warm temperature.

In addition, the unified scale of Figure 3 visually flattens the response curve in T1 in July&#8230; although I&#8217;m not sure this is worth re-drafting the figure over.&#8226;\tFigure 6 has positive soil depth values! I assume these are aboveground vegetation measurements or have missed a key point, but clarification would be welcome.&#8226;\tFigure 7 legend should probably have a wider legend key to show the distinct line-types.                 The authors clearly state their research goals and explain their methodology. I have no major comments for this section, but I would suggest that, in the case of flux measurements, more measurement events during the year would have been welcome and, ideally, would have been performed for several years.                 The authors clearly present their results and include all underlying data in the supplement. My main concern above about the frequency/duration of measurements does not invalidate their findings in any way, but simply reflects a desire for a more complete picture of the ecosystem.             Comments:Some specific comments below. The last comment (regarding lines 502-504) I believe would greatly improve the perceived impact and importance of post-glacial colonization ecosystems to other fields.&#8226;\tLines 92 to 97 describe Figure 1, which are three hypothetical flux trajectories following colonization. All three show a similar, fundamental trend of increasing respiration with increasing assimilation of C. However, keeping the fundamental trend in mind (as A increases, R should also increase due to plant maintenance R as well as soil R), more than these three cases can be imagined. In addition, &#8216;time&#8217; here is clearly meant to be at least somewhat hypothetical, but the x-axis could be labeled with phase of succession rather than arbitrary numbers. Likewise, I would recommend removing the arbitrary numbers from the y-axis altogether.&#8226;\tUnpacking the above strictly for Scenario 1: The authors claim this scenario depicts a soil-dominated outcome where maximum sink capacity (A-R) is achieved in the later stages, where soil is most fully developed. However, given that soil R is a function of (among other things) the size of the soil C stock, we might imagine that in later stages of succession where a steady-state is achieved with maximum plant cover and fully developed soil, that the sink capacity would actually be less because it is under these conditions where soil R is maximized (due to the large stock).&#8226;\tI am not looking for a specific response from the authors, as they do mention (lines 121-122) that the overall trajectory is likely to be driven by an interplay between plant and soil development. I would, perhaps, consider emphasizing that the scenarios presented are idealized &#8216;end-member&#8217; hypotheticals somewhere in the paragraph on lines 92-97.&#8226;\tLine 151 (and subsequent mentions): The third transect site is named &#8216;Conoid&#8217;, but I don&#8217;t quite understand the significant of this moniker? Is this a discipline-specific term? If it is arbitrary, I might suggest using a more descriptive term for the third transect (e.g., &#8216;old growth&#8217;).&#8226;\tLine 297: This should reference Figure 5, right?&#8226;\tLine 306-307: This series of estimates of BG stocks is difficult to read. Consider editing or removing and focusing on the reference to the Table.&#8226;\tLine 374-376: How much of this could be attributed to changes in phenology? I am not familiar with the site type and species, but shifts in plant resource allocation that occur during a season could account for some of this change, right?&#8226;\tLine 433: This thought has occurred several times during reading&#8230; but how certain are you that T3 represents primary succession from T2? Presumably there are not many disturbances that may have occurred, but since there is no age estimate for T3, it may not present the final stage of primary succession for the T2 (or T1, for that matter).&#8226;\tLine 477: Another thought&#8230; if we wanted to calculate total C storage on previously barren land, then we should measure soil C to bedrock, yes? While 0-15 cm may be sufficient for estimating total C storage in T2, this may not be the case for T3, right?&#8226;\tLine 502-504: I am glad the authors returned to this point. The yearly accumulation flux is fine, but better would be the following: compare the glacial albedo radiative forcing to the radiative forcing of the CO2 captured and stored as C stock within the new ecosystem. This would allow a direct estimation of just how much of the glacial radiative forcing that is lost by retreat is offset by plant colonization. If data are available, a further comparison to forest ecosystem C stocks in the region could provide a forward-thinking estimate if the tree line is actually likely to move into the current study site.

The investigation is performed to a high standard and the methods and results are clearly presented. In the author comments I point out some ideas for minor improvements.                 The data are well presented and the findings are placed in context with a relevant discussion of the meaning and implications. I give a few suggestions and more detailed comments in the author comments, below. I am curious whether there are specific projections for glacial retreat in the Matschertal? If yes, this could be mentioned to provide context for the expected rate of change. The data are provided with the exception of September fluxes, which seem to be missing from the excel document. In figure S1 I think it would be helpful to show the current glacier extent in relation to the transects. For the data reported in tabular form explicit metadata would be helpful. This can be short and just a description of columns and abbreviations.             Comments:Line 53-54: could be more clearly/directly phrased, eg: Glacial expansion in the Alps peaked around 1860 and since then have been retreating leaving an abundance of bare ground&#8230; Line 72-74: does this study measure changes in energy balance? This sentence could be deleted. It is an interesting fact that is not totally relevant to the C cycle focus of the study. Line 75: use a direct object.

The phenomenon of glacial retreat or of the radiative forcing discussed in the previous sentence?Line 81: why the mention of black carbon here?Line 92-97: this is nice.Line 102: I think this would read more smoothly if changed to: &#8216;the variation in carbon and nitrogen is considered to influence photosynthesis and respiration equally&#8217;. Line 103-111: I&#8217;m not sure I totally understand the mechanisms for prevailing soil processes? Is that because microbial communities and soil C&amp;N cycling might have a stronger influence on C dynamics than the vegetation? This paragraph talks a lot about plants, it might be better to focus on the soil?Line 112-118: scenario 3 is laid out very nicely, focused on reasons why plant processes could be the most dominant mechanism for C accumulation. Line 139: That&#8217;s a nice map. Would it be possible to indicate the current glacial extent as well? Maybe a dotted line? Or perhaps a google earth image with T1-T3 indicated for reference? Line 212: the data provided in the supplement is missing September? I found only July and August. The data is well organized and generally easy to understand. Still, I would having a metadata page that describes the columns and some values. For instance, what are 2b,3b,etc and &#8216;ck&#8217;? One of those is presumably a repeat with no filter. I understand that f0-f11 are increasing filter thickness (decreasing light). Why was the zero-filter measurement repeated again at the end? I think typically we assume that full photosynthesis might take some time to recover which is why we measure from full to low-light conditions. Line 192-194: oh, that&#8217;s a cool method! Line 214: modified how? I am not sure what modification would be needed to the light-response method? Line 227: September data are missing in supplement?Line 244: This is a nested design, with 5 chambers nested within each transect. Was a nested analysis (mixed effects model) tested? The sample size is quite small so it might be difficult but a mixed model might have greater statistical power because it could account for presumably greater similarity between collars from a single transect.

Many readers might not know these terms since this is not a journal for glaciologists. And could the terms be linked explicitly to T1, T2, T3?Line 390: The comment on forest establishment needs a little more context. Is temperature the primary limitation? Do dispersal and soil development play a role in limiting trees? Line 397: presumably the relationship between BG biomass and soil present a feed-back. As more soil develops more roots can grow, which leads to more soil formation?Line 423-428: this sentence is a little hard to follow.

Olfactory cues are stimuli detected by the olfactory sense but fish have several chemical senses (smell, taste, common chemical sense) and I am only aware of handful of studies that examined the roles of these systems in detecting predatory and alarm cues and all of these were in  freshwater.

In this manuscript titled &#8220;Relative telomere length and oxidative DNA damage in hypertrophic ligamentum flavum of lumbar spinal stenosis&#8221; the authors examine the role of telomere shortening and oxidative stress as possible mechanisms underlying lumbar spinal stenosis pathogenesis. The authors present data to claim that hypertrophic ligamentum flavum (LF) obtained from patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) has lower relative telomere length (RTL) and higher oxidative stress compared to non-hypertrophic LF samples obtained from the same patients, using whole DNA extracts. Furthermore, the authors present data showing lower RTL and higher senescence associated &#946;-galactosidase in fibroblasts isolated from hypertrophic LF tissues of specific patients.This manuscript provides some evidence of accelerated senescence and oxidative stress induced DNA damage in hypertrophic LF tissues of patients with LSS compared to normal LF tissues of the same patients. Some noteworthy aspects of the manuscript:1.\tThe authors have provided detailed descriptions of the experimental methods and provided sufficient background information relating to the study.2.\tUse of non-hypertrophic LF tissues from the same patients as negative controls.3.\tAcknowledging the limitations of the study in an honest manner.                 1.\tFrom Figure 1, the RTL of non-hypertrophic LF tissues is marginally higher than hypertrophic LF tissues and from Figure 2, the 8-OHdG levels is marginally lower in non-hypertrophic LF tissues than the hypertrophic counterparts. This phenomenon is constant in all age group of LSS patients used in the study (i.e. from age 45-87- data on supplemental S1-sheet 1).Although use of non-hypertrophic LF tissue samples from the same patient is a good negative control to show that telomere shortening and oxidative damage is accelerated during hypertrophic conditions, it is possible that these non-hypertrophic tissues (especially if obtained from the lumbar area) are showing early signs of telomere shortening/oxidative damage that can result in low statistical significance. This can be seen from the fact that the RTL of non-hypertrophic and hypertrophic LF fibroblasts is comparable after passage 3 (Figure 3). If the authors have access to normal LF tissues or LF fibroblasts from normal age-matched people with no LSS, or any other normal comparable tissues, that would serve as a good control to determine normal RTL and 8-OHdG levels. 2.\tThe authors have used fibroblasts from patients aged 61, 66, and 77 years to examine RTL changes during passaging. The RTL represented by T/S ratio in the first passage of hypertrophic cells from the above patients are 3.36, 4.32, and 4.82 respectively (Supplemental S1- sheet2). However, the RTL (T/S ratio) of the hypertrophic LF tissue from the same patients is 1.61, 1.43, and 1.19 respectively (Supplemental S1-sheet1). Can the authors explain why LF cells in culture have different RTL compared to the parent tissues from which they have been isolated?3.\tIn the discussion, paragraph 2, the authors state &#8220;We showed that hypertrophic LF tissue from LSS patients presented shorter RTL than non-hypertrophic LF tissue, suggesting that the hypertrophic LF tissue may exhibit high turnover rate of cell division.&#8221;The authors are encouraged to present data comparing the growth rate of hypertrophic and non-hypertrophic LF fibroblasts.4.\tIn the Discussion, paragraph 3, the authors state &#8220;Cells from elderly patients might have lower levels of telomerase activity and senescent cells accumulate with age.&#8221; In the absence of data about telomerase levels, can the authors include &#946;-galactosidase data for the patients in the 45-55 age group?

The concept of &#8220;imperviousness&#8221; is used throughout the manuscript, and while I assume it&#8217;s just the proportion of concrete and man-made hard surfaces in the environment, it might be good to define this a little better for the casual reader. L104. Why was the DNA extract from the filters diluted 1:100? L109. The primer bias and non-detection issue was discussed in the manuscript, but given that these are new primers and may end up being useful to the eDNA community, it might be worth running an in-silico step to determine rough degree of primer coverage over perhaps a selection of local marine species that have data on GenBank. The program MFEprimer is quite good for this (https://github.com/quwubin/MFEprimer). L312. Another possibility to consider which might explain the results are prevailing winds or tides. Obviously these factors influence where humans settle, and there also may be an effect in consistently pushing water from areas of higher biodiversity toward or away from other areas?

Comments:The study entitle &#8220;The use of bathouses as day roosts in macadamia orchards, South Africa&#8221; investigates factors associated with the structure and environment of bat houses influence bat occupancy in a region where little is known about important roost characteristics. I believe this study is an excellent contribution to the field of using artificial structures for conservation in agricultural areas, especially for species that provide vital ecosystem services through crop pest control. Overall, I found the manuscript to be well written and the study methods and analyses to be robust. I only have minor comments on the content in the manuscript as outlined below:1.\tFigure 1: Could you add a zoomed in aerial image of the study location showing: 1) where the orchards were located within regard to one another, and 2) where the bat houses where located within those orchard sites? This would allow the reader to better understand the distribution of the bat houses in each of the orchards (since different numbers of the types of bat houses are placed in each orchard site) and get a better sense of proximity to water and other landscape features.2.\tLines 135-137: I&#8217;m a little confused which three bat houses in each of the orchard sites received an IButton unit. Is it the three multiple chamber houses but not the black/white ones, the rocket ones or the colony one? Please clarify. (Note: once I read the results it did become clear that it was the 3-set of bat houses, but perhaps you could clarify in the methods still)3.\tI agree with the idea that type of bat house may be confounded with temperature and insulation of the central bat house, since that was the warmest bat house (most likely due to its location in the set up and had more chambers). What this made me realize though was I didn&#8217;t see (or may have missed) what the type of bat house was for the black/white pairing. Can you add this information somewhere or make it more apparent, if I missed it? If the black/white bat houses were the six chamber house, then perhaps temperature is the most important, but of course factors affecting temperature are also the number of chambers which help insulate it.4.\tWhy do you report 166 individuals in the results and 220 individuals in the discussion? Please address this discrepancy.5.\tMinor: should it be bathouse or bat house? It&#8217;s called the North American Bat House Program, so perhaps separating the words is most appropriate?                                                ", "The manuscript was generally well written but it could be more concise and checked for the occasional incorrect use of tense. While a minor matter of personal preference, and not necessary to change, my preference is to reference literature without the extra words (e.g., &#8220;According to&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;The review of&#8230;&#8221;) as this is implied. Instead I acknowledge the published literature with appropriate citations but very rarely noting the authors in anything other than parentheses. For instance Lines 66-68 could be reduced to &#8220;Peer-reviewed studies focusing on artificial roost site use by African bat species are literally non-existent (Rugger et al. 2016).&#8221; In fact, the three sentences that speak to the review of Rugger et al. could be combined into 1-2 sentences.Lines 60-65 - the link in the first paragraph of global bat decline to bats being useful for pest control to the lack of knowledge of bat roost preferences and artificial roosts is not clear. While implicitly understood, perhaps this could be made more explicit?While it is understandable that there is limited published literature on bat house use by bats, I think the authors rely too much on dated grey literature when there might be published alternatives, even if dated.  For example, there is reference to Kiser &amp; Kiser (2004) to substantiate comments on roost fidelity and parasite loading when instead &#8220;Lewis, S.E., 1995. Roost Fidelity of Bats: A Review. J. Mammal. 76, 481&#8211;496.&#8221; could be used. If this study was indeed meant to be an extension, build upon, or be a confirmation of the Bat Conservation International newsletter findings, perhaps it could have been framed that way?                 While the overall concept of the research is important and could help inform bat conservation - determining the key features of artificial roosts used by bats - I am not convinced that this study/analysis was sufficient to disentangle key features from potentially confounding factors.While not incorrect to use the term &#8220;occupancy&#8221;, this term is fairly unambiguously used to describe occupancy modeling (e.g., MacKenzie et al. 2005). Perhaps &#8220;bat use&#8221; instead? The authors acknowledge that bats have occupied the boxes on days when no bats were physically present. Was the fact that bats had been present between monthly visits noted and included in the analysis? If bat use was recorded monthly, wouldn&#8217;t the present of faeces be an indication of presence during the month and be worthy of inclusion into the analysis? Perhaps as an overall measure of &#8220;bat&#8221; use - i.e., aggregate all sightings and indications of use as &#8220;use&#8221; for the month and re-run the analysis, particularly as there aren&#8217;t any fine-scale temporal covariates?I think the statistical methods could be written more clearly. Could the full model be written out for clarification? I&#8217;m assuming the full model was something like: Bat presence ~ Bat House Type + Altitude + Distance to Water + Height of Bat House + (1|Farm) + (1|Month). Is this correct? I wonder if &#8220;Time Since Installed&#8221; should be a fixed factor as literature supports (and this manuscript acknowledges) that bat use of artificial roosts generally increases over time. The fact that 21 bat houses (in sets of 3) were installed years earlier than the other bat houses and the remaining houses were all installed in May or March 2016 makes me wonder if the reason that the colony house had no bats was a confound of only having 1 replicate of that type and it being installed in March 2016.I&#8217;m not quite sure why the data for Bat House Type &#8220;Colony&#8221; was removed - if the model is set up as I wrote it then there is no reason for data to be removed. I&#8217;m also not clear on why Farm and Month are used as random factors. The authors acknowledge that there might be some sort of temporal trend but then use Month as a random factor. Why not convert month into a continuous variable (such as a sine/cosine function) and keep it in the model as a fixed factor to test if there is a temporal trend? I&#8217;m also a little concerned with the use of the &#8220;dredge&#8221; MuMIn function and the low sample sizes. Considering all of the tests that are run using dredge, might the few statistically significant results be spurious (i.e., if you run 100 tests you should expect 5 of them to show significance from random chance)? Table 1 is not very useful. It&#8217;s not clear from the methods/results how the models were run (see comments above) and thus it&#8217;s not clear if this is the best top model (as suggested by the AICc score, which is the same for all variables and thus redundant in this table) or if these were competing models, which is normally what would be presented with AICc scores. Could a table of all possible models be presented with AICc scores or delta AIC to give the reader an idea of how many models were run and how &#8220;good&#8221; the top model is in relation to all other models? Did the authors run a null model and full model to compare against their top model? It would be useful to see the results, especially if the top model is significantly better than the null/full (i.e., comparing log-likelihoods using something like the anova() function in R). In addition, have the authors thought about calculating the evidence ratio to determine the strength of evidence for each variable? It might be valuable for the authors to review Burnham et al 2011 prior to a revision of the analyses. (http://www.ericlwalters.org/Burnham_etal_2011.pdf). I&#8217;m not clear on the purpose of the iButtons recording temperature in only 3 (adjacent?) bat houses. What was the ambient temperature? Is mean temperature something that is truly important to bats? I would imagine it might be the maximum/minimum/difference from ambient that might be the most useful as houses that are too hot/cold might be detrimental to bat health. Can the authors provide a rationale for why they chose mean temperature and justification how this small replicate test can provide insight into bat house preferences? Also, I would revise line 190 as p=0.55 is not a &#8220;marginal significant difference&#8221;.Is it possible to include a figure of the study area/sampling design? Perhaps the current study area figure (Fig 1) could be included as a small inset to orient the reader to the region with the main figure showing the placement of box types in relation to one another and to the other farms. This would help the reader understand how nested/confounded the experiment is. It would also be quite useful to have some sort of symbol for each of the different type of box and have the size of the symbol proportional to the number of bats detected in the box. I found it very confusing to try and remember the experimental set-up and number of occurrences in each bat box type from reading the manuscript in its current form.What is the landscape surrounding the farms like? From Figure 2 it seems that it might be treed, although this could just be my ignorance of what macadamia orchards look like. If it is treed do you think this might influence bat use of artificial roosts? I.e., will you be less likely to have bats roosting in the bat houses if surrounded by natural roosts and, if yes, is the surrounding habitat consistent around all farms? This relates back to my comment above suggesting a figure to help the reader understand the layout of the sampling design and if there might be confounding factors. While a nice picture, Fig 4 seems irrelevant to the study as there was no research relating bat house use to insect availability or insect observations/data of any kind.                 Unfortunately, I did not find that the data was robust, statistically sound or adequately controlled. Nor did I think that the conclusions were limited to supporting results.Much of the &#8220;suggested&#8221; in the discussion might be better framed as author speculation. While interesting thoughts, I might argue that the research does not actually suggest these findings but the authors are speculating based on the findings and/or observations as much of the discussion relates to the observed data rather than results from any statistical tests. For example, is the conclusion related to bat preferences of warmer houses accurate (lines 207-208)? From my reading of the methods I thought that temperature was only recorded in one set of 3 boxes, but not in the set of white/black boxes (lines 134-137). Please clarify the methods. Assuming there was only temperature recorded in the set of three bat boxes, how can there be the conclusion that bats preferred warmer temperatures? This is not substantiated by the findings of bats occurring more frequently in the central bat house and in the black bat houses as temperature was not measured in all the boxes nor related to bat house use in any statistical test.             Comments:Other comments: Is bathouse a word? I would write it out as two words or bat box, as is typically written.Line 164 notes that there were 166 individual bats observed while line 203 notes 220 individual bats.

As the result, they didn't find significant diversities both in calls and haplotypes among the populations. I agree that the methods and results described in this manuscript is fair and making sense. However, their assumption and interpretation are skewed. because they assumed existence of selective pressure and interpreted their results only from the perspective of selection without taking any notice of neutral random drift. As they gave multiple examples, there are some selective forces on advertisement calls in some cases, but that depends on the species and their surrounding environments.They also argued these results are good for the conservation action such as reintroduction program to the type locality. However, I seriously doubtful on that because the advertisement calls is only a single part of phenotypic characters of the organism. There are some more issues on reintroduction and/or relocation over the compatibility of evolutionary significant units and introduction of diseases along with individuals. Further, they argued that there are frequent migration rates among the populations because they found little nucleotide divergence of 16S rRNA haplotypes. But the mitochondrial molecular marker is haploid and mother inheritance, and 16S rRNA gene is comparatively conservative gene in mitochondrial genome and thus slower mutation rate. Therefore the molecular marker is inadequate to discuss gene flow and migration among local populations. Little diversity of haplotypes among the populations should not be result of gene flow but just an few mutation accumulation due to younger isolation time of the populations.In my subjective view, they seem to be challenging to use big words even based on the negative results. I recommend to rewrite the manuscript amenably on the results.                 Their advertisement call assessment is adequate, but genetic analyses based on mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene is not.                 The results itself is fine.

At the least, the authors should explain and defend the rationale for this choice.  I would prefer to see the authors repeat the analysis with one or more alternative methods to see if the analysis yields similar results.L203 and L227:  I must be missing something, but if frequency range shows the highest coefficient of variation, how is this consistent with the general pattern, if the general pattern is for spectral traits typically have low acoustic variability (see Line 86).

The region of mtDNA sequenced (part of the 16S gene) is notoriously conservative, so the fact that minimal distances were found between populations is not surprising.  This would also make it very hard to detect any associations between phenotypic differences (i.e. call parameters) and genetic variation.  With respect to conservation, arguing that populations are genetically &#8220;replaceable&#8221; goes far beyond what you can reasonably conclude from these results.  You would have to look at a variety of markers known to be highly variable across populations to have a remote case for this claim.  Overall, I thought the choice of genetic markers for this study was not appropriate, given the conclusions proposed.

This is also likely why the estimated tract lengths in Table 2 are suspiciously small, since estimating bacterial recombination parameters depends on the rate at which r^2 decays in addition to the r^2 value it asymptotes to. My prior to what Neisseria data may look like include Budroni et al. 2011 (PNAS) for N. meningitidis and Arnold et al. 2018 (Genetics) for N. gonorrhoeae. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with proving previous studies wrong, but a key methodological difference is that the previous authors either used whole-genome alignments with Mauve (Budroni et al 2011) or also found core genes like you do, but kept track of their positions using a known, contiguous reference genome (Arnold et al 2018). Alternatively, your analyses are done on alignments generated from concatenating core genes (Concatenated how, by the way? Did you attempt to preserve synteny or concatenate them in random orders?). Thus, distances between SNPs may be systematically underestimated if the accessory genes present between core genes are not accounted for. If there is a recent insertion of a rare accessory gene in-between two core genes, this is likely not an issue for you, since most of the evolutionary history of the flanking core genes is spent adjacent to one another just as you have put them in your concatenated alignments. However, there could be intermediate- and high-frequency accessory genes that could cause problems here. These insertions between your core genes could also be very large, making SNPs that are adjacent to one another in your concatenated alignment have linkage dynamics that resemble the genome-wide background, which would make r^2 decay overly quickly with distance.Inaccurate estimates of distances between SNPs could also affect your ability to detect linked selection, and perhaps why so little of it was detected in N. gonorrhoeae. It may also make patterns even stronger for N. meningitidis.Given the low sample sizes of genomes here, it could be feasible to generate alignments from progressiveMauve that should preserve synteny. The pangenome tool &#8220;Roary&#8221; may also make some attempt to keep synteny in the alignments it outputs, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure how reliable they are. In any case, I have a hunch this could be an issue, but happy to be proven wrong.\tMoreover, while it is acknowledged that clonalFrameML may not be able to detect all interspecies admixture events (since detection of these events is biased towards either longer recombination tracts and/or ones that are from more diverged donor species), I&#8217;m not exactly sure how to feel about the analyses in Figure 2+3. For instance, is there any way to get an idea of how much interspecies admixture made it past the clonalFrameML detection step? Your Figure 5 shows that your use of concatenated alignments may have made it more problematic by artificially truncating recombination segments, but even with perfect alignments this could still be a potential issue. Can only linked selection produce negative correlation between piN/piS vs piS, such that even if there were interspecies admixture, this is still evidence? While interspecies admixture can certainly explain the correlation between piN and piS, can it also contribute to the linked selection signal? It seems this could be the case if the donor population was larger and had more efficient purifying selection, making admixture tract lengths introduce more synonymous than nonsynonymous polymorphisms. Nonetheless, I just don&#8217;t have the best intuition for this so commenting in the discussion how much this could drive results would be helpful. I understand detecting *all* interspecies recombination is a very difficult task and on ongoing challenge for the field.Lastly, these two species could have different population structures, resulting in N. meningitidis having larger Ne. To me, this is never really presented as a serious alternative hypothesis in the paper, and all analyses are done basically treating both species as single populations. This is probably valid for N. gonorrhoeae, but may not be for N. meningitidis? In particular, I&#8217;m thinking of Smith et al. 1993. I&#8217;m not suggesting that a thorough analysis of population structure be done, but it would at least be useful to mention. They do both have values of Tajima&#8217;s D close to zero, but it&#8217;s hard to interpret if this means no structure or if its from a balance of factors that create positive and negative values of D that, genome-wide, average out to zero (e.g. structure with purifying selection). However, perhaps structure still does not drive lower piN/piS in N. meningitidis, suggesting it truly has larger Ne even if some structure is present.Minor comments:For the paragraph starting on line 133, could you please provide more motivation behind why you used different sets of synonymous polymorphisms to ranks gene and to get averages across a group? I kind of see what you did there but am left wondering why you did it.Line 198 &#8211; I would personally appreciate if it could be emphasized that this is a difference in the population mutation rate (2Nu), not a difference in the physical mutation rate (u).

I think this should also get mentioned here, since it was on my mind until it was eventually mentioned in the discussion.Line 279 &#8211; after you give the slopes for Ng and Nm, there are numbers in parentheses that follow the slopes. What are these numbers? P-values?Paragraph starting on line 299 &#8211; For this analysis do you remove genes that have experienced interspecies admixture?

I think this should also get mentioned here, since it was on my mind until it was eventually mentioned in the discussion.Line 279 &#8211; after you give the slopes for Ng and Nm, there are numbers in parentheses that follow the slopes. What are these numbers? P-values?Paragraph starting on line 299 &#8211; For this analysis do you remove genes that have experienced interspecies admixture? Wouldn&#8217;t this deflate levels of divergence? Although why it would tend to deflate dN more than dS (making dN/dS &lt; piN/piS) is not exactly clear to me, and perhaps it shoudn&#8217;t. Nonetheless, it isn&#8217;t immediately clear to me how to interpret these results in the presence of interspecies admixture.Line 341 &#8211; g in &#8220;NG&#8221; should be lowercaseLine 367 &#8211; or differences in population structureLine 434 &#8211; should &#8220;refs&#8221; be populated with numbers referring to references?

All tables and figures are lacking full descriptive information and informative labels.                 The genomic comparative analysis of the two pathogenic Neisseria species is useful in understanding their relationship within the genus and the techniques used in this manuscript are suitable for this type of analysis. However, the manuscript does not present what problem the analysis is meant to address, what the gap in knowledge is, or what the hypothesis is regarding the problem or gap.                 The manuscript does not contain any information on how the sub-set of genomes 'from Genbank' were chosen or how the quality of their assembly was assessed.  The NCBI (Genbank) lists &gt;90 Nm and &gt;20 Ng genomes filed as &#8216;complete&#8217; however some of the genomes chosen for this analysis are actually poor assemblies.  How was the data set assessed?  No conclusions were presented; what is the added value of this analysis to the field?             Comments:The analysis confuses meningococcal colonization (carriage) with invasive infection (disease), for example: Nm asymptomatic carriage rates are presented but the analysis uses Nm invasive disease genomes, which have a different prevalence. The analysis should be redone using a more appropriate data set or correct prevalence rates.There are inconsistencies through out the paper; for example: the introduction states a 8-25% rate of carriage, yet in the discussion (citing the same 2004 and 2005 papers) states the rate is 5-20%.  Additionally, there are more current publications of infection and carriage rates; for example see the WHO 2018 Meningococcal meningitis report and the CDC Meningococcal Disease web page.                                                ", "The overall structure of the manuscript is fine, with all results presented in an adequate order, but the style of writing, lack of properly formatted equations and the style of referring to previous works and techniques, makes it very hard to read. This readability issue may have affected the clarity in the exposition of novel results.A main issue in this article is that it is not entirely clear how the reported results will contribute to the literature in Neisseria or the knowledge of processes affecting diversity of bacteria. For the most part, results are presented as an exploration of some population genetic measures and comparison of these measures between two species of Neisseria. The authors might want to discuss more throughly how their results in Neisseria compare to those from other bacteria and how they lead to novel findings about the strength of the evolutionary processes acting on these bacteria.                 The experimental design of this work, per se, does not require deep revisions, unless the authors could figure out a way to either independently estimate the effective population size for the two species under analysis or to separate its effect from those of selection.Since the above is hard, I think this work covers all that can be extracted from this data but, as mentioned above, should undergo extensive review for better clarity. Before such revision, accessing the relevance of this work is hard.                 Although well performed, It is not clear whether these results actually add something, even as replication. Other works in the same field either (i) introduced novel analysis techniques and models or (ii) compared and inferred general evolutionary processes acting on the organisms studied. I cannot identify such features in the current manuscript.             Comments:I believe this work will be publishable after extensive review of its writing style, as stated above.

", "This work reports on a study of the self-association of a non-pathogenic form of the protein Ataxin-1. Overall the reporting is good with a logical structure. However, the presentation is not the most effective and there are room for improvement. The article may benefit from more vigorous English grammar checking. There are sentences that are cumbersome and straining and needs rewriting. Some figures, labels, and symbols used can be improved to enhance clarity.                 The methods used are appropriate and designed to give answer to the biological question under investigation. For in vitro protein interaction studies, fluorescence-labelled fusions were used to monitor protein localisation and foci formation inside the cell. This was used to identify the self association regions for foci formation. Protein fragments were checked for interactions in vitro and in vivo with the FRET method which is a sensitive and well established method.                 The interpretation of experiments are in general solid and sound and the conclusions are well justified.[1] I have some concerns about the way the authors using the terms &#8220;sufficient&#8221; and &#8220;necessary&#8221; rather loosely.p.4, line 6 &#8220;AXH is also necessary and sufficient for the majority &#8230;&#8221;Most interaction studies (Y2H, GST pulldown) define what is &#8220;necessary&#8221; but cannot conclude if one component is &#8220;sufficient&#8221;.p.5, line 3 &#8220;necessary/sufficient&#8221;What does the stroke mean?&#8220;The AXH domain is insufficient to form foci &#8230;&#8221; (Title of Section)I agree with this. The AXH needs to be extended N-terminally to form foci, according to this section&#8217;s results. But the last sentence, &#8220;&#8230; the aggregation-prone AXH domain does not have a predominant role&#8230;&#8221; is not supported by these results. The results in this section suggest that AXH is not sufficient, but nothing suggest that it is unimportant.[2] In the discussion of TLND2AXH, it was said to &#8220;formed foci that were, however, smaller in size as well as in number.&#8221; I agree with this. However, the authors should also discuss that a lot of the fluorescence remains diffused like those formed by other constructs that do not form foci at all. (Fig. 4A,B,C) I think this is actually a very interesting construct because it captures something in between, able to form foci but not all of these do. So, while all other constructs are all-or-none (foci or diffuse), this is a ~half-and-half. And the rest of the article should discuss referring to this result as such, including the respective entry in Table 1.[3] P.9 Section Ataxin-1 contains dual dimerization motifsI don&#8217;t think this section title summarise well the content here.[4] While CT2AXH has no doubt more convincingly displayed foci-forming; TLND2AXH shows only partial foci-forming and small foci, suggesting that the interaction may be incomplete. So TLND2AXH is less representative of the protein-protein self interaction of Ataxin-1. I do not understand why the authors chose to work with TLND2AXH rather than CT2AXH for SEC.SEC results: This is the paragraph which I found most problematic. It is well documented that unstructured proteins run at different elution volumes to those calibrated by globular proteins. Without detailing how to calibrate (e.g. there were previous works on how to correct for elution volumes for unfolded proteins) the TLND2AXH (assuming it is unfolded), one cannot really analyse the results and conclude that it &#8220;is in equilibrium between two species&#8230; &#8220; and &#8220;has an elution volume compatible with that of a monomer and a dimer.&#8221; Also the retention volume is lower not higher for TLND2AXH. It does not make sense to compare the elution volumes of a folded and an unfolded protein and account for the difference in calculated molecular masses. &#8220;The elution volume (12.7 ml) of the higher molecular weight species of TLND2AXH&#8230;&#8221;From what I can read, the 2 peaks of TLND2AXH are 11 ml and 12 ml. The 12.7 ml peak belongs to AXH.&#8220;&#8230;significantly smaller that expected for a trimer or a tetramer.&#8221; As explained above, need more vigorous calibration to discuss the estimated molecular weight of an unfolded protein.From these discrepancies, it seems likely that the authors have mislabelled the 2 samples in Fig.5 and have the 2 proteins swapped. Everything makes a bit more sense if the continuous line represents TLND2AXH, except that the molecular weight estimation of the unfolded TLND2AXH still demands more vigorous treatment rather than descriptively as it is.p.12, last 2 lines. Discussion about gel filtration results here should be amended to reflect whatever the authors have revised according to the comments above.[5] The authors did not give any evidence to support that TLND2AXH is unfolded.[6] p.12, 2nd paragraph, line 5 &#8220;This incorrect assumption has lead &#8230;&#8221;I think it is quite harsh to say that an earlier work aligning self association to exclusively within the AXH domain was an&#8220;incorrect assumption&#8221;. After all, supported by this work, AXH domain does contribute significantly, although not exclusively. I suggest the authors to reword here. And then in line 7 &#8220;&#8230;clearly shown that this is not the case&#8221;. For the same reasons, it is not entirely &#8220;not the case&#8221; but is &#8220;half a case&#8221;. I suggest to reword here too.[7] dimerization and self-associationp.10 line 3 &#8220;dimerization/self-association&#8221; What does the stroke mean? To my understanding, dimerization and self-association is the same thing. While there is no attempt in this study to further characterise the order of the oligomerisation state, they mean the same. In some places, these two terms were used like they are different states. E.g. p.13 lines 4-6. What exactly is the difference between these two terms?  I have an impression that the authors describe the interaction observed in the crystal structure of the AXH domain as dimerization and everything else self-association. However, dimerization is just one specific form of self-association.  Again, in the conclusion this differentiation was made again. Can the authors clarify this a bit clearer --- defining what they mean by self association in the text as in its difference to dimerization.[8] More discussion of Fig.7 is needed. Why does CT2AXH lead to increased FRET? It is worth mentioning that both AXH and TLND2AXH individually are slightly reduced compared to full-length Atx1.

It should be:https://github.com/sjspielman/amine_receptors                 The new method is based on alignment using MAFFT, and structural curation of the consistency of aligned structural domains: transmembrane, intra- and extra-cellular.When proposing a new approach for sequence alignment, it is necessary to compare its performance to previously published methods. In the case of the present study, the new method can (and should) be compared to methods that were designed for structural-aware alignment, especially the consideration of TM domains, and even specifically for GPCR proteins. The study by Hopf et al. 2012 has done exactly that (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2012.04.012), based on alignment by HHblits (Remmert et al. 2012, doi:10.1038/nmeth.1818). MP-T (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts640) was also developed for structural-aware alignment of TM proteins, and was found to be more accurate than both MAFFT and HHblits. Another program is TM-Coffee (doi:10.1186/1471-2105-13-S4-S1). Therefore, the publication of a new method requires comparison of performance relative to these previous ones. Which variant of MAFFT was used (e.g. L-INS-i?) and why?In addition to masking residues that disagree with the structural domain prediction, badly aligned residues can be identified using tools such as HoT (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18229673) and Guidance (doi: 10.1093/nar/gkq443), and if the aligner is switched - also T-Coffee (or TM-Coffee) consistency scores. It would be interesting to compare and combine the different predictors of alignment errors.Page 3 paragraph 3: The conclusion that &#8220;our structurally-curated MSA featured far less error than did a structurally-naive MSA&#8221; is not supported by the presented results. Alignments with less gaps are not necessarily more accurate. Some alignments may be &#8220;over-aligned&#8221;, i.e. more compact than the true alignment. Also the prediction of secondary structure is not a strong indication of alignment quality, because it is merely a prediction. I suggest using actuall protein structures as a benchmark, which is the common practice in the field (e.g. Balibase and also in the abovementioned MP-T paper). There are multiple amine receptors in the PDB, which can be used for structural alignment. Then the accuracy of the proposed alignment can be assessed by comparison to these structural alignments.&#8220;Structurally-aware MSA strongly improves phylogenetic inference&#8221;: The likelihood scores of trees built from the naive and structurally-curated alignments cannot be compared using AIC or in any other way because some of the sequences were removed in the filtering. Only likelihood scores of trees built for the same sequence data can be compared. Therefore, I suggest removing the same sequences also from the naive alignment (without re-aligning) and running raxml on that. The resulting tree of the same number of sequences will probably still be different from the tree that was built from the structurally-curated alignment. Then the likelihood scores may be compared.Another way to show the superiority of the tree is if bootstrap scores are higher than the naive tree.MrBayes is usually superior to ML algorithms such as RAxML. I suggest applying it to the best alignment. If the run time is too long because of the large number of sequences, then I suggest sampling a smaller number using CD-hit (http://bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/).Page 5 last paragraph: what was different between the models in RAxML for the different partitions? For the TM domains, a TM-specific matrix should be used.                 &#8220;or this clade represents an avian-specific diversification which the Xenopus tropicalis sequence resembles only convergently&#8220; - convergence is very unlikely to mislead phylogeny reconstruction into joining neighboring clades that were not truly sister clades in their evolution. Also, if HRH-2 contains non-avian sequences than it is not possible that the new clade is an avian-specific diversification.As in the specific discussion of the TAAR clade, it would be interesting to note which species are present in each of the other subfamilies, and thus infer an approximate dating of their origin. E.g. if some clades are tetrapod-specific then they may be the result of functional specialization that occurred after the divergences of tetrapods.

E.g. if some clades are tetrapod-specific then they may be the result of functional specialization that occurred after the divergences of tetrapods. Others that include also fish species are more ancient.

Furthermore, there were numerous cases in which entirely incorrect words were used. For example, line 309 states, &#8220;Participants were advised (both informally and on the consensus form)&#8230;&#8221; This sentence should read &#8220;Participants were advised (both informally and on the consent form)&#8230;&#8221; The words consensus and consent mean entirely different things. The authors should have someone with a strong English background edit the manuscript to eliminate these mistakes throughout the manuscript.Introduction and Related Work Sections:The researchers make an admirable attempt to bridge the gap between the field of computer science and the field of psychology. However, the introduction does not provide a solid theoretical background or basis for the study. The background provided for the role that affect plays in job performance was significantly lacking. For example, Affective Events Theory (AET) is a theory used to explain how moods and emotions influence job performance and job satisfaction. The authors should consider the inclusion of AET as a theoretical basis for their research. Furthermore, the authors would be advised to review the research in the field of Industrial/Organizational Psychology, where much work has already been conducted examining the role that affect, emotions, and moods play in job performance and various job related outcomes. For more information on AET see: Wiess, H. M. &amp; Cropanzano, R. (1996). Affective events theory: A theoretical discussion of the structure, causes and consequences of affective experiences at work. In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), Research in Organizational Behavior: An Annual Series of Analytical Essays and Critical Reviews (p. 1-74). Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.In addition to lacking a strong theoretical foundation, this manuscript consistently used the term psychometrics incorrectly. Psychometrics is a subfield of psychology that focuses on the theory and techniques of psychological measurements. More specifically, the field of psychometrics deals with the design, development and validation of psychological measures. Throughout the manuscript it seemed as if psychometrics was being used as a &#8220;buzzword&#8221; to excite the reader(s) and was being used in reference to simply the use of a psychological measures or some kind of benefit that is provided by using a psychological measure. This is not correct.In general, the Introduction section and the Related Work section both seemed very disorganized. The flow of the manuscript did not create a logical or theoretical progression to the hypotheses. The incorporation of a theoretical foundation, such as AET, should help to better develop the rationale for the hypotheses. In the Related Work section, much of the literature cited from the field of psychology is outdated or entirely false. For example, the authors state, &#8220;It is difficult to differentiate terms like affective state, emotion, and mood.&#8221; However, much of the research in the field of social psychology agrees that emotions, moods, and affect are entirely separable constructs. Therefore, the authors should review more recent literature dealing with affect, emotion and mood.Constructs and Psychometrics Section:If the authors are not going to use the PANAS (as stated in lines 212 &#8211; 220) do not include background information about the PANAS. When discussing the PANAS, the authors cite that the PANAS only captures high-arousal feelings in general. This statement is only partially true. There are different versions of the PANAS depending on the level of affect the researcher is interested in studying. For example, the PANAS can be used to measure more stable trait level affect or more momentary state level affect. When discussing the SPANE, the authors state that the SPANE assesses positive and negative experiences during the past 4 weeks. If the researchers are truly interested in how affective states influence job related outcomes, the researchers should not use a measure that aggregates experiences across 4 weeks. A scale that measures positive and negative experiences that occur over 4 weeks is not measuring affective states. Although the authors cite reasons for not using the PANAS, the PANAS would have been better suited to measure affective states because one version of the PANAS asks participants to rate the degree to which they are currently experiencing various positive and negative feelings. Thus, the PANAS would have been able to actually measure changes in the participants&#8217; actual affective states.Similarly, when discussing the SPANE, the authors state that the SPANE-B could be used to split participants into groups using a median split. This is a very arbitrary and inappropriate technique for several reasons. First, median splits artificially create groups. Second, median splits limit the types of analyses that can be conducted. Third, similar to the second, median splits remove precision that was originally available in the continuous measure.                 Hypotheses Section:Lastly, when the hypotheses are presented it is not clear exactly what they research is examining. The hypotheses should be clearly stated in words not formulas. By not clearly stating the hypotheses in words, it is confusing to the reader what is being examined. For example, without flipping back pages, it is unclear what BCRn-pos actually means and how it is different from BCRpos. In a related comment, the authors do not actually define and operationalize what pos and n-pos actually mean. Context and Participants Section:The researchers state that a &#8220;formal experiment&#8221; was conducted. However, given the information that is presented in the manuscript, this is far from true. A form experiment is a study in which there is random assignment to groups and the researcher actually manipulates the independent variable. Neither of these things was conducted. The authors could make the argument that a quasi-experimental design was used. However, a correlational research study best describes the research methodology employed in this study.The information provided in the Participants Subsection of the Results and Discussion Section (lines 395-405) should be moved to the Context and Participants section. There is no need to have two Participants sections in the paper.Procedure Section:Lines 356 &#8211; 361 should be removed. Instead the authors should simply state what the alphas were for the various measures. Lines 370 &#8211; 379 should be removed. They detract from the flow of the paper.Lines 382 &#8211; 383: There were no conditions in the study. No variables were manipulated.                 Hypothesis Testing Section:The first thing that is stated in this section is the &#8220;the data could not permit insightful regression analysis.&#8221; This is entirely false. The data could have been analyzed using regression analysis. In fact, the data would have been more appropriately analyzed using regression analysis for multiple reasons. This would have allowed the researchers to retain the precision of the SPANE-B as a continuous scale (without dichotomizing the scale using a median split). Second, the regression analysis allows for the researcher to control for theoretically or empirically confounding variables. Third, regression analysis does allow for the test of curvilinear relationships. This last point is mentioned because Figure 8 and Figure 9 appear to display a curvilinear relationship. Lastly, regression analysis is fairly robust against minor violations of normality.The presentation of the inferential statistics is inappropriately presented. When presenting psychological research, one needs to adhere to the guidelines in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association 6th Edition. Evaluation of Results and Implications Section:The conclusions drawn from this study are not entirely supported by the data. For example, line 470 states, &#8220;The empirical data does not support a difference in the creativity with respect to the affective states of the participants.&#8221; The distribution of scores shows that most people were positive in their affective states. Additionally, the SPANE-B does not really measure affective states. Similarly, lines 478 &#8211; 482 are not supported by the data or results. First, no analyses were conducted examining the degree of relationship between ACR and SPANE-B scores. Therefore, lines 478 &#8211; 479 cannot be stated. Lines 481 &#8211; 481 state that specific relationship cannot be claimed at this stage. This is also false. Incorrect data analytic procedures were used in this study. If multiple regression techniques were used, specific relationships could actually be determined.In line 500, the manuscript states, &#8220;A paired t-test proved that the increase&#8230;&#8221; This is scientifically inaccurate. In research, we never prove a hypothesis. We only support or fail to support a hypothesis. Proof implies indisputable evidence.Lines 514 &#8211; 516 are also not supported by the study or the data. First, no mood induction techniques were actually used. The researchers manipulated none of the participants&#8217; moods. This study could not have empirically demonstrated that the SPANE is capable of detecting mood induction effects because no moods were induced.Validity of the Study Section:Line 533 states, &#8220;Although the number of the participants is acceptable&#8230;&#8221; How was this determined?

The paper has a good scientific background and is well-contextualized regarding the literature; in addition, the language used is clear, unambiguous and professional. However, several points are critical to be considered regarding the methodological approaches used (particularly from the point of view of methodology description, experimental design and statistical analysis). I have also raised a series of questions regarding the necessity of further experiments to adequately test the hypothesis of this study.Abstract and Introduction1. The goal and the relevance of the study need to be described in a narrower way. What phenomenon does the study intend to model? In the introduction, the author discusses the use of SSRI in adolescent patients suffering from depression and anxiety disorder. However, this study does not use an animal model of depression or anxiety to mimic what is observed in the clinical practice. The author also discusses concepts about stress, but uses no intervention to evaluate a response to a stressor stimulus.2. There is some important issue of concept. In many instances, the author uses generalist terms assuming that there are changes in brain levels of serotonin, but this parameter was not evaluated in this study. The modulation mechanisms behind the mechanism of action of SSRI are complex and indirectly involve other neurotransmitters and receptors. Therefore, without performing a technique to ascertain the levels of neurotransmitters, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), for example, it can not be inferred with certainty that there was actually a change in serotonin levels at the fluoxetine concentration used in this study. (see lines 18 and 195).3. The author hypothesizes that juvenile exposure to fluoxetine would reduce cortisol levels and elicit anxiolytic effects in the novel tank test in adulthood, but does not propose a neurophysiologic mechanism by which the chronic fluoxetine treatment of juvenile zebrafish would lead to biochemical and behavioral changes in adulthood.4. Please add the phrase about the novel tank test (100-104) in the Materials and Methods section. 5. The phrase \"These data suggest that juvenile fluoxetine exposure does not elicit any adverse or maladaptive effects on stress reactivity in young adult zebrafish\" (19-21) is generalist, as the study solely evaluates cortisol levels and behavioral parameters. The term \"stress reactivity\" may not be ideal, since in this study the animals were not exposed to a stressor stimulus (such as acute or chronic stress). Materials and methods6. I believe there is a typographical error in line 147.                 The manuscript only partially follows ARRIVE guidelines and there is a need for more minute descriptions of the experimental design. Gerlai, 2018 (Reproducibility and replicability in zebrafish behavioral neuroscience research, doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2018.02.005) and Masca et al. (2015; doi:10.7554/eLife.05519) discuss important issues of reproducibility and replicability in scientific research, which must be taken into account: 1. In the Animal section (111-115), besides citing a reference, the author needs to add the maintenance details. In this study animals are used at different stages of development, requiring different types of food, maintenance and housing. How were food (commercial food, artemia or paramecium) and maintenance handled at these different stages? Was the density of animals in the aquariums controlled? What were the parameters of water quality used? Was the system water obtained from reverse osmosis? In addition, it is very important to add the approval number of the ethics committee.2. Studies show that there are differences between males and females (see Rambo et al. 2017, doi: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.12.032), both in behavior and in stress response. Why was this not considered in the statistical analysis?3. The author states that there are no studies of chronic treatment with fluoxetine in juvenile zebrafish (89-91) and, therefore, there is no known optimal concentration for the drug in this case. Moreover, the concentration used was chosen according to studies performed in adult zebrafish, most of them with acute exposure, not reflecting the design of the present study. In this case, why did the author choose not to establish a dose-response curve of fluoxetine treatment?  6. Most references cited in this manuscript use acute or chronic stress protocols to more concretely evaluate animals' responses to stress. In order to evaluate stress response, I think it would be necessary to expose the animals to a stressor stimulus. In this case, why did not the author use this type of intervention in this study?7. Please add the dimensions of the apparatus used for the novel tank test (133-134).8. Please add the P value considered as the cutoff for statistical significance in Data Analysis (155-159).                 1. An important question is about randomization and blinding. Masca et al. (2015) and Gerlai (2018), examining the problems of reproducibility in biomedical research, state that one of the main reasons for irreproducible research is the lack of blinding/masking. The author describes that randomization was performed to allocate the animals to the treatment groups (control x fluoxetine) (116-117), but were the animals randomized as to the order of testing in the novel tank test? What was the method used for random allocation in the treatment groups? Were experimenters blind to treatment? Were data analysts blind to treatment? These questions need to be addressed and clearly stated in the methods section.2. Other important issue is that there is a misconduct in the use of degrees of freedom and describing terms of t test statistics. You should not just remove an outlier from a specific parameter; when you consider an outlier animal, you should remove it from all parameters.3. I believe the term &#8220;main effect&#8221; should not be used for t test. Please review this concept and change the manuscript.             Comments:1.

Considering the relatively small sample size of these two non-European populations, it comes as no surprise that no novel loci were identified in the GWAS or the XPEB analysis. Previously reported lipids-associated loci were confirmed in the current study, and novel genes (BACE1 and SIDT2) near known SNP (rs662799) were identified using S-PRediXcan, providing new evidence of the possible underlying mechanisms. The manuscript is well organized and the statistical methods were appropriately implemented. A few minor comments for the authors.(1) For the XPEB package, it took SNPs and P values as input as well as the sample size of the included ethnic groups. According to the package manual, SNPs with variation &gt;10% of the median sample size is not acceptable. Roughly half of the GLGC participants were genotyped using common Affymetrix or Illumina GWAS arrays while another half of them were genotyped using Metabochips which included far less SNPs. As a result, a few SNPs in the GLGC dataset showed sample size &gt;10% deviation from the median sample size. Were these SNPs before running XPEB? For the SNPs that were missing in the base population (i.e. GLGC), the package manual provided methods to do imputation. Were the missing SNPs imputed or simply exclude from the analysis?(2) For Table 3 and Table 4, I recommend add a column showing SNP position in addition to chromosome.

This sentence and the results in Supplemental Table 3 were confusing. &#8216;The earlier significant SNPs&#8217; may refer to the significant findings in the GWAS analysis, which were CETP on chr16 for HDL and APOE on chr19 for LDL. However, there was a significant SNP at PCSK9 on chr1 with FDR&lt;0.05 in Supplemental Table 3. Please rephrase this sentence and correctly describe the results.(6) For Supplemental Table 4, I recommend re-sort the SNPs first by locus, then by FDR values.                                                ", "This manuscript is clear, concise, and professionally written. I found the methodology and approach each to interpret.The introduction was thorough and explained the rationale behind the study.To the best of my knowledge, basic reporting guidelines were met.                 I have some concerns with the experimental design of this study:1. The authors state that S-PrediXcan/MetaXcan was used on summary statistics from the CEBU and Yoruba cohorts to identify gene-based associations. I do not understand why a summary-statistic based approach was used when raw data is available. Although MetaXcan and PrediXcan are equivalent when using European data, my understanding is that this is not true when using non-European cohorts. I would recommend that authors either a) re-run genic association analyses based on raw data; or b) calculate LD Matrices from the CEBU and YORUBA populations for use with MetaXcan; or c) provide evidence that the two approaches are analogous even when applied to non-European data.2. I am concerned about the use of the GLGC cohort as a replication data set. The introduction of the manuscript states that the samples includes \"7,898 non-European-ancestry individuals, including the children of those in the Cebu cohort\". How did the authors account for this potentially substantial relatedness within the cohorts? In particular, I note that the GLGC results have significant overlap with the Cebu PrediXcan results- how was relatedness accounted for in this replication analysis?                 I have some concern with the validity of the findings in this study.1. I am concerned that the prediXcan/metaXcan analyses do not include sufficient correction for multiple testing. Currently, authors correct for the number of genes within each tissue, but do not take into account that 44 tissues are tested. My rough estimate (44 tissues * ~5,000 genes/tissue) gives a stricter significance threshold of 2.2e-07. According to this estimate, no genes are significant in the Yoruba population, and &lt;5 in Cebu. While this correction may be overly stringent given eQTL correlation between tissues, I feel that this is worth noting as a caveat to your results. Perhaps an alternative, less conservative approach, would be to apply a study-wide 5% FDR correction.2. The authors identify multiple genome-wide significant associations in both the Yoruban and Cebu SNP-based GWAS, which cluster into specific loci.  In my opinion, it would be advisable to carry out some type of conditional analysis to identify lead signals in these loci. For example, for the Cebu cohort, authors list the top 10 significant SNPs in Table 4- these are all in the same locus (Figure 2), and are all in fairly high LD (&gt;0.6). It therefore seems uninformative to list all these SNPs - instead, why not use GCTA-Cojo, FINEMAP, or similar, to identify the lead SNP (s) in this and other loci, and list those? The same is true for the S-PrediXacn results (eg, presented in Table 6). Authors identify multiple associations in 11q23.3, across multiple tissues (and presumably there are multiple sub-threshold associations in this region also). It would be interesting to see the correlations of GREX between these genes in these tissues, and perhaps to carry out a conditional analysis of these associations.

"], "10.7717/peerj.6329": ["Pamminger et al present an extensive dataset on nectar concentrations in 322 species of wild, cultivated and weedy plant species from across the major world continents. The paper is well structured and well written throughout, with only a few areas that need to have their phrasing polished up which I detail below. The results are interesting (a very consistent average nectar concentration found in insect pollinated plants across all regions) and highlight particular crop genera that may benefit from additional nectar sources in the surrounding landscape to benefit bee populations. The figures and tables are clear and the statistical techniques used are well described. The literature is reasonably well covered, but I would like more discussion of the evidence base as to why the sugar concentration in nectar is important, and which species of bee this evidence is drawn from (predominantly social bees). I go into this point in more detail in section 3.                 The research question is well defined (the importance of sugar concentrations in nectar) but as detailed in the next section I would like some more discussion of whether or not this is valid to apply to all bees.                 I have a few more major comments that I would like to see addressed. The major point is that the manuscript talks about the importance of nectar to 'bees', but almost all the evidence we have that nectar concentrations are important comes from social bees (Bombus, Apis, etc). I think the data presented is really interesting, but I find it hard to argue that nectar concentrations are quite so important for solitary bee species (the vast majority of bee species) that have mainly had their fitness linked to the type and quantity of pollen available to them. I think a slight rewrite that shifts the focus (and justification for choosing nectar as the response variable) onto social bees would make the manuscript more representative of our current understanding of how important nectar is to bees, given the substantial knowledge deficit that exists for solitary bee species. L69-71. I would argue strongly that maintaining a diverse bee community has not been the focus of agri-environment schemes targeted at bees. Early work in the UK focused strongly on bumble bees and their foraging requirements Carvell et al 2004; 2006; 2007 leading to currently incarnations of flower-rich field margins containing predominantly bumble bee food plants (e.g. Trifolium, Centaurea, Vicia and so on). Until recently, few pollinator-focused schemes were appraised for their ability to provide resources to a wide variety of wild bee species e.g. Scheper et al 2015 JAEL72-75. I think you need to be careful here. Most of the work that has be conducted on floral resource quality (especially nectar) has been on social bees. Next to nothing is known about how nectar quality affects solitary bee fitness, and if it even does at all. Pollen quality has been more extensively studied, but still predominantly on social bees (Vaudo, recent work on polyfloral/monofloral pollen diets for B. terrestris colonies from the Michez lab). For solitary bees, the limited amount of work suggests that it is the quality of the landscape (i.e. density of floral resources) that determines bee fitness e.g Persson et al 2018 Ecology and Evolution. I would lay out a couple of these issues in a little more detail in the introduction to highlight that most of the nectar work comes from social bees, which are of course very important as pollinators due to their abundance in most ecosystems. L152. This dataset from Kim et al 2011 is restricted to a narrow selection of bees in Apinae, e.g. Bombus, Apis, Meliponini and Euglossini, all but the Euglossines being social bees. These bees, whilst capturing a lot of the social diversity, are not necessarily representative of the other 19,000+ bee species and so statements such as &#8220;However, all evidence suggests that bees avoid foraging on nectar sources below 20% sugar concentration, likely because the caloric intake cannot support sustained foraging activity with potentially detrimental effects for the bee colony&#8221; are not necessarily true for solitary species. An earlier discussion of the ecological differences between social and solitary bees seems warranted. If the paper was to state that the focus on nectar was to better inform management for social bees (as is implied by the focus on nectar and references to colony health) this would resolve many of these issues. As it is currently written, the paper refers to &#8216;bees&#8217; but focuses mostly on social bee examples and on a problem (nectar concentration) that has not empirically been demonstrated to be an issue in solitary species. L326-327. I was interested to read this reference to see what evidence the authors present, but it is incomplete and gives only the title of the book without publisher information. Looking it up online, the subtitle is &#8216;the most important food sources for the honey bee&#8217;. As written, the current sentence &#8220;While it is well-known that pears (Pyrus) are not considered attractive to bees due to their low nectar (Fig.3) quality (Maurizio and Grafl 1980)&#8221; is misleading, since the evidence is for honey bees only, and pear is known to have attractive pollen for spring-flying wild bees, particularly Andrena (Chambers 1946 J Animal Ecology; Westrich 1989 Die Wildbienen Baden-W&#252;rttembergs). Focusing the manuscript more explicitly on honey bees, bees known to be sensitive to nectar concentrations, would seem more appropriate.

", "The manuscript is generally well-written and well structured in professional English and easy to read. The introduction is convincing and presents the background information necessary to understand the objectives of the paper. Additionally, the figures are relevant and well described.However, the raw data has not been supplied. It is necessary to include a list with all species for which nectar sugar concentrations were found and the references. This list could be in the appendix.                 The study is well designed and the approach is appropriate for the research questions. However, some important information is missing, for example the exact search terms for the search in ISI web of knowledge and google scholar. Additionally, all data bases that were searched should be mentioned to make it possible to repeat the study.In the method section on the statistical analysis some important information is missing, for example which test was used to test which hypothesis. Moreover, I think that it is difficult to compare the variability of nectar sugar concentration between crops, weeds and wild plants. The authors write themselves that the higher variability in wild plants is probably due to the fact that this group includes more taxa. Unless the authors do not account for the number of taxa included in the analysis I don&#8217;t think that it makes sense to test for these differences.                 The authors have compiled a large data set of reported nectar sugar concentrations from the published literature. Therefore, the findings are robust and the conclusions are supported by the data. However, I wonder how important the sugar content really is for bees. For example a mass flowering crop might provide such a high nectar availability that the sugar content might be completely unimportant. These constraints could be more emphasized in the discussion. Additionally, I miss some more concrete ideas how the data is useful for pollinator conservation. For example, I like the idea very much to combine this data set on nectar quality with the timing of flowering in plants. Why was that not done in this study? It could be very useful to know when most crop/wild plant species are not flowering to support plants that provide nectar of high quality in times of scarcity.

The structure, figures and tables seem good to me. However, I have my concerns about the relevance of the results (detailed in the comments to the authors).                 The work is within the aims and scope of the journal, but I think that it fails to fill a gap of knowledge (see comments to the authors).                 See comments to the authors.             Comments:This study aimed to evaluate the species diversity of populations allocated to Centrolene buckleyi and the taxonomic status of C. venezuelense, for which a series of standard unilocus species delimitation methods were applied. As a result, three candidate species were identified and the distinction of C. venezuelense was ratified. The methodological approach and the interpretation of the analyses are relatively simple so there should not be ambiguities in the taxonomic decisions derived from the results. However, I have several serious disagreements with this study.1. The authors first highlight the advantages of using delimitation methods based on coalescence (lines 40-46), but finally recognize that these methods actually diagnose genetic structure, not species (lines 278-279). Consequently, the authors consider their results as \"a first assessment of species boundaries of the C. buckleyi species complex\" and recognize that their single-locus data provide \"a preliminary view of species boundaries\" (lines 275-278). So, what is the contribution of this research to the taxonomy of the C. buckleyi complex? One of the arguments that suggest that C. buckleyi is a complex is \"its lack of monophyly\", which can be inferred from some of the articles cited (e.g. Guayasamin 2008, Twomey et al. 2014). Therefore, the only novelty of this study is that C. buckleyi would be composed of at least four lineages that could correspond to different species. I agree \"that in this era of biodiversity crisis, it is urgent to increase the rate in which the biodiversity is characterized\" (lines 292-293), but it is not clear to me why the authors did not formalize any of their findings. I suppose that the authors are working on the description of one or more of the candidate species, but by not including this final step, there is practically no progress in solving the problem: C. buckleyi is still a species complex (something that could already be inferred from previous analyses) and C. venezuelense would be a good species (something that other authors had said).2. The distribution of C. buckleyi complex covers more than 1000 km and the authors only included specimens from five localities. Is this enough to evaluate the diversity in a taxon that apparently includes several species whose distributions are obviously not known? Why were not more populations assigned to C. buckleyi included? From Ecuador, for example? (Cisneros-Heredia &amp; McDiarmid 2007) I think that sampling is insufficient, in number of localities and specimens, to solve a taxonomic problem of that magnitude.3. My third main point is about the interpretation of the results of the delimitation and distances analyses. Usually, the idea behind using various methods of delimitation is to seek instances of congruence between them (i.e. candidate species supported by all of them) and to resolve cases of inconsistency by going to information from other sources, unless the authors favor one method over another. Here I do not see clearly what strategy the authors applied. First, the methods of delimitation recognized between 21 and 25 species, but where is explained what criteria were used to choose between the methods? In the discussion, apparently, the authors favor the delimitation obtained with bGMYC because of its greater sensitivity and because it has been used successfully in other studies of amphibians (and you will always find examples where any method works well!). However, the fact is that there are many examples in the literature where this method fails in the delimitation of species, mainly due to overesplitting (e.g. Miralles &amp; Vences 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014, Pentinsaari et al. 2016), and the same could be applied to other methods. Conversely, the results of PTP analyses are discarded because they group C. sabini and C. buckleyi 2 as a single evolutionary unit. But why is the conspecifity of C. sabini and C. buckleyi 2 an equivocal delimitation? (line 254) Can not there be a species of amphibian that is distributed along 1300 km? In this case, the short branch lengths that separate these taxa are striking (Fig. 2), so intermediate samples are required to elucidate this issue. Second, the two methods try to accommodate intra- and interspecific processes along the branches of a phylogeny so the question is, how does the present sampling influence the performance of the methods, when most of the data are one specimen per species? Of course the proponents of the method say that it works very well under a wide spectrum of conditions (e.g. Fujisawa &amp; Barraclough 2013), but the present data set do not allow to evaluate if the method is really distinguishing intra/interspecific patterns of molecular variation. And third, regarding the genetic distances, what is the point of calculating the distances only between the focal populations? This does not add additional information to what one can observe in the phylogeny, but it does provide a clue that the authors neglect. Are the genetic distances that were obtained between the candidate species low or high compared to the other species in the group? Although the authors do not provide all the distances between species, it seems that the values between C. buckleyi 3 with C. aff. buckleyi and C. venezuelense are the lowest of all the species of the genus included. I am aware that genetic distances are not an unequivocal indication of species status, but those values are well below the values that have been proposed as a thumb rule for the limit of intra/interspecific divergence (3-5%) for the 16S in amphibians (e.g. Vences et al. 2005, Fouquet et al. 2007, Matsui et al. 2016, Walker et al. 2018). According to this yardstick, even the other candidate species (and surely other species included in the phylogenetic analysis) do not reach enough divergence to be considered as full species (I think that the pair C. sabini-C. buckleyi 3 fall in this category). I reiterate, there is no fixed value to define the boundary between the intra/interspecific divergence, but the genetic distances between some populations of C. buckleyi and other closely related species are quite low enough to consider the possibility that they are conspecific.4. My last main point is about the other types of evidence that the authors provide as additional support for the distinction between candidate species. In the discussion they point out that glassfrog species in general are altitudinally segregated, giving the example of C. buckleyi 1 and C. buckleyi 3. However, the data of C. buckleyi 3 are only from the Yanayacu Biological Station and of C. buckleyi 1 only from two localities (Table 1). What about all the other populations of C. buckleyi from Ecuador? (Cisneros-Heredia &amp; McDiarmid 2007) Is there enough geographic data to claim that both species segregate altitudinally? On the other hand, the authors cite differences in calls between both species, but the data are from one specimen per population. Similarly, is there enough data to establish if there are significant differences in this trait? My opinion is that the knowledge of the phylogeny, biogeography and bioacoustics of this group of anurans is still too incomplete to support those taxonomic suggestions with such fragmentary data.In short, I believe that this work does not represent a significant advance in the taxonomy of the C. buckleyi complex because its main result is only to confirm that this taxon is a complex, formed by at least four species. I think that sampling is insufficient to solve such a complex problem and that the authors do not adequately argue their methodological choices. Moreover, It is not clear to me why authors provide only partial information to support the specific status of some of the candidate species (and why they refrain of describing them formally), and in turn ignore their own genetic distance data, which suggest that some of the populations may be conspecific.I have a few minor comments, but I did them in the corresponding text in the pdf.

", "The manuscript is well-written and clear, with good coverage of relevant literature. I think the introduction could have a bit more context. It is basically paragraph 1 about species delimitation, and paragraph 2 is already the specifics of the taxonomy of the buckleyi group. I think a paragraph to bridge these two paragraphs could be a good addition. Specifically, it would be good to convey the importance of finding candidate species. Most people would not argue against the significance of actually describing species, but here no species are described so I think you need to \"defend\" why identifying candidate species but not describing them is still important. It could also be worth mentioning drawbacks, if any, with using coalescent-based delimitation methods.                 The methods are described in detail, however, as I mentioned in an email to the associate editor, I do not have expertise in coalescent-based species delimitation, so I cannot adequately review the technical aspects of those analyses.                 The interpretation of the results is generally sound, although in some cases relies on some subjective acceptance of one delimitation method vs. another. I expand on this in point 2 of the general comments section.             Comments:1. Overall the main goal of the paper isn't entirely clear. It seems to me that applying these coalescence methods should be a tool towards some greater objective, like describing a species or maybe using the identified taxa to evaluate some biogeographical scenarios. But in this case the application of the method seems like the endgame. The most obvious way this could be rectified would be to actually describe the species here. That would of course entail a lot more work on the manuscript but it would make crystal clear why the authors would use these delimitation methods. I understand the authors want to get more data before doing this so formal descriptions might be unfeasible. Otherwise, this aspect of the manuscript could be improved by better emphasizing in the introduction why this study is important. I touch on this a bit in the basic reporting section.2. I think that using a battery of methods kind of undermines the idea that these methods are an improvement over traditional taxonomy in that they reduce subjective interpretations. For example, which of the 5 methods is 'correct' with respect to Ce. sabini and Ce. buckleyi 2? The authors argue that because of biogeography it is extremely unlikely these two are conspecific, but in my opinion it is completely possible (glassfrogs have some crazy distributions, for example we found Cochranella erminea something like 900 km north from the type locality, and some of the Amazonian Hyalinobatrachium have similar stories.). On one hand it's good to see how different methods treat the same dataset, but using all these methods comes at the cost of increased subjectivity during interpretation. I don't think there's a good way around this but this could be touched on in the discussion.3. Figure 3 could be improved by including all the terminals on the tree. For example, it seems like only a single buckleyi 2 and buckleyi 3 is included in that figure, but from the results section it sounds like all the terminals were included in the analysis. I think showing everything is important for that figure because it allows the reader to see whether the methods are oversplitting (ie. splitting what are definitely single species, like two sequences originating from the same locality). Related to this, including multiple terminals from species where multiple sequences are available (e.g. Ce. charapita, Ce. sabini, possibly others) could help evaluate over/under-splitting, which could broaden the scope of the discussion a bit. For example if GMYCs also splits charapita into two species, you'd have an indication that this method seems too liberal in delimiting species.Specific comments:Introductionlines 29-30: \"urgent challenge in biodiversity hotspots\".

The main result is that in several cases bicodon preference is shared between related organisms. The work generally contributes to the growing understanding of the determinants of codon usage bias and translation kinetics. While the current manuscript is not of sufficient quality for publication, it should be reconsidered if the concerns listed below are addressed. First and foremost, a recent beautiful paper experimentally characterized the role of adjacent codons in regulating translation elongation through screening of a large synthetic library of GFP variants in S.cerevisiae (Gamble et al. Cell 2016; PMID: 27374328). I would strongly recommend to the author to cite and build upon this work early on, e.g. by presenting a clean statistical analysis that generalizes and expands the findings from the work by Gamble et al. across additional organisms.  &#8226;\tThe manuscript contains too many colloquial phrases.  A thorough revision of the language used to increase clarity and professional/scientific English will greatly improve this manuscript&#8226;\tThe introduction, background, and referenced literature are generally adequate. The manuscript structure conforms to PeerJ standard. &#8226;\tIn the current form, not all figures are relevant, high quality, well labelled and described:Figure 2:  The y-axis labels could be bigger, and the y-axis of panel A should end with a tick mark and label to indicate the range of the plot. Relabeling the legend in the plot to &#8216;expected&#8217; and &#8216;observed&#8217; may clarify the figure, but this is merely a friendly suggestion. Moreover, the figure legend states that shown is &#8220;the frequency of bicodons observed in a set of 500 coding sequences&#8221;. I do not think that 30% (0.3) of codon duplets in 500 coding sequences are &#8216;AAAAAA&#8217;. The author should be careful to describe exactly and correctly what is shown (i.e. here the relative frequency of synonymous codon pairs)Figure 3: The author should fix the y-axis. This is the same data as Figure 2 and a little superfluous. The author could add this graph as additional panel to Figure 2 for easier direct comparison. Figure 4: This figure is not very informative in its current form. The figure legend does not specify which &#8216;statistical distance&#8217; is used and illustrated. The coloring might be biased by extreme values in the top two panels as there seems to be almost no signal in the bottom two panels. The author could highlight codon pairs that have been found to significantly deviate from the expected frequency through the statistical analyses of this work to make this figure more informative. Figure 5 is missing axes labels and units. I do not understand what is plotted here, thus cannot draw any conclusion from this figure. &#8226;\tThe data underlying the presented statistical analyses are provided in three Excel tables. Table1 and 2 are missing column names or any other form of annotations, so it is not clear what the numbers mean.                 &#8226;\tGenerally speaking, the study comprises original primary research within Scope of PeerJ. &#8226;\tThe research question is somewhat clear until the start of the results section, where the authors states: &#8220;The aim of this paper is to associate coding sequences with their relative translational speeds&#8221;, which differs markedly from the initial introduction as analysis of bicodon usage across organisms. The author should check that all statements are consistent and true to what was actually done. &#8226;\tIt is not clear why binomial coefficients are computed, as I cannot find further reference to them. Please clarify or remove them from the methods section&#8226;\t Similarly, Shannon&#8217;s entropy is introduced in the methods section, but not referenced again. The paragraph describing Shannon&#8217;s entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence should be clarified and the exact wording carefully checked. A normalization through division by log(n) should be better justified. &#8226;\tThe statistical approach following (Gutman and Hatfield, 1989) is sound, appropriate, and sufficiently rigorous. The usefulness of Entropy and KL divergence to quantify differential bicodon usage is not necessarily demonstrated here. An alternative way to estimate how robust any statistical differences are would be e.g. an analysis of randomized sequences. &#8226;\tResidual scores reported as statistically significantly deviating (between observed and expected) may be more informative than a classification based on an arbitrary threshold of 5. &#8226;\tThe author keeps making reference to p-values &gt; 2 or more. This is against the definition of p-values and does not make sense. I assume the author means the negative log-transformed p-value, but this has to be clarified in the manuscript (and called something other than \"p-value\"). &#8226;\t The author also includes ribosome profiling data in his work, but does not specify at all how these data were processed and analyzed.  The methods should be clarified to provide sufficient information to replicate all analyses.                 &#8226;\tData (genomic nucleotide sequences and curated expression datasets) is generally robust, and the approach statistically sound, and controlled. However, anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences do not cause ribosome attenuation. The original paper (Li et al. Nature 2012), while a clever idea, has since been shown through careful biochemical work to be an artifact of sequencing and analyses methods applied (Mohammad et al. Cell Rep 2016; PMID: 26776510). Thus, some analyses by the author are based on an incorrect hypothesis. These have to be removed and/or corrected. I suggest, as mentioned above, to exploit the direct experimental evidence of a role of codon pairs in translation speed to establish a link between bicodon usage bias in multiple organisms with a likely function in regulating translation&#8226;\tGenerally, conclusions are well enough stated but speculation should be contained. For example the sentence &#8220;But first it is needed to solve the link between density and ribosomal speed at the nucleotide level, due to the fact that a pause at a given site will stop the transit of many other proofreading upstream ribosomes, increasing artificially the ribosome density of the upstream sequences. &#8220; is not only grammatically incorrect, but also wrongly states that a translational pause necessarily will stop following ribosomes (if the transcript is translated by polysomes at all), as well as that ribosomes are &#8216;proofreading&#8217;. Similarly, the sentence &#8220;If we consider an average of three alternative codons for coding each amino acid, there exist more than 1.3&#215;10143 manners to codify a protein with 300 residues.&#8221; needs to be corrected at multiple levels. I cannot follow this back-of-the-envelope calculation (and it would not be difficult to use the actual degeneracy of the genetic code to make this a correct statement instead of using an average degeneracy); this calculation seems to ignore any constraints on the amino acid sequence; &#8216;encode&#8217; may be a better (more correct) word than &#8216;codify&#8217;; etc. There are many sentences of this sort in the present manuscript. All sentences throughout the manuscript should be carefully corrected for clarity and correctness.             Comments:The overall rationale of this work, is sound, but I strongly recommend that the author thoroughly revises the present manuscript to improve on clarify, presentation and correctness of all statements.

The author presents a method of identifying coding sequences that may affect ribosomal movement along the mRNA by analyzing bicodons. The investigation is statistically sound and the author uses three different quantities (chi-squared, pause propensity, and Shannon's entropy) to support their conclusions about bicodon preferences in high and low abundant proteins.In Methods, there are several mistakes that would make it difficult to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript:- Line 101: I believe that this is the equation for a normal distribution, but it is missing a normalization factor.- Equation 1: Variables k and l are not defined.- Chi is used in several places when I think the author means chi-squared.                 I have one major comment about the analyses presented in the manuscript. As the author mentions in Discussion, mRNA abundance could be a major confounding factor in these analyses. However, the Discussion and Conclusion are written under the assumption that different bicodons affect translation rather than transcription.

The authors have presented a rather straightforward process in which whole genome DNA from a single individual was prepared using standard techniques and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Mitochondrial baiting and iterative mapping using several published reference mitogenomes were used to extract sequencing reads from the complete set of reads. A de novo assembly was performed on this subset of reads, and the resulting contig was circularized, evaluated for consistency with other published genomes, and annotated. Phylogenetic analyses with other published mitogenomes yielded largely expected results, with one unexpected topology.

So far, only Tiagabine is the only FDA-approved drug against epilepsy, with a number of side effects, therefore the search for an effective inhibitor with no or minor side effects is eagerly awaited.                 There have been many attempts to develop useful lead molecules or drug candidates as GABA inhibitors. GRID independent modeling is a relatively new approach in the field of SAR therefore, it was reasonable to apply the method for the study of GABA transport inhibitors.The method was appropriate addressed, and it has been supplemented by molecular modeling and docking studies, as well. Molecular modelling and docking was carried out appropriately. Modeling was based on the structure of dDAT, which was most probably the closest homologue of hGAT-1 at the time of the writing. (It is to note, that the structure of human DAT and SERT has been already determined, which will probably be even more similar templates than dDAT for further studies). Otherwise, altogether appropriate care was taken to the modeling process. Concerning the GOLD docking procedure, a relatively large cavity was left for the antagonists to bind. This has the advantage of leaving enough space for the antagonists, however, it might have led to several binding modes in a number of cases.  The number of GA runs and other settings fit to the generally applied standards.Methods were written carefully enough for reproduction..                 The findings are nicely presented. Table 1 is especially carefully detailed, giving a nice example of how data is to be presented.Overall, the findings are summarized in Fig. 9. Namely, two hydrogen bond acceptor contours (N1) at a distance of 8.00-8.40 &#197; from each other. and a hydrogen bond donor (O) at a distance of 5.60-6.00 &#197;, and finally a hydrophobic group at a distance of 10.40-10.80 &#197; form the hotspots for hGAT-1 inhibitors, therefore a COOH group at meta position of the piperidine ring may provide an important interaction point within the binding cavity of hGAT1.This finding is well stated and linked to the original research question. It can be directly  interpreted in terms of developing hGAT-1 - inhibitors in the future.             Comments:Overall, it is a well written paper, there are only a few questions remain to be answered.In row 221 it is stated that the binding site was kept flexible. However, in row 228 it is said that the side chains of hGAT-1 were kept rigid.If you mean, they were kept rigid outside the binding site, please state it explicitly. In supplementary Table 4 the top scoring hits get an unusually high score,(even around and over 70) while the score of the selected poses are much less and they cover a narrower range. Does it mean, that the top pose appeared only once, and there were several other poses? How many times did the \"selected poses\" appear in the run? The quality of the figures 5, 6 and 7 should be improved, in terms of sizing. It may be due to the PDF processing, but the figures seem to be \"pressed\" from the sides.

Figure 6 B,  the close view of class A, B and C are distorted and should be improved. Figure 7 should be in a better quality.                 The research question of this paper is well defined and very relevant. The search for new inhibitors for GAT1 is an important topic of research, since according to the authors, there is only one second-generation FDA approved anticonvunsant agent for human sapies GAT1 (Tiagabine). Besides analogues of this drug Tiagabine that have been developed are often associated with off target toxicity and poor ADME-Tox properties (lead to side effects). Some points of the methodology need to be more detailed to have sufficient information to be reproducible:- the workflow of the hGAT1 antagonists data preprocessing: it is necessary to discuss about the chosen criterion (molecular weight and IC50) for filter the 375 non duplicated initial antagonists as well as the next steps &#8220;assay type&#8221; and &#8220;cell line&#8221; filters.

", "In general, the manuscript follows PeerJ policies. The introduction states that the field of knowledge is coral bleaching, however it should be bleaching due to the use of zoantharian species. As a suggestion, the introduction as well as the title should be modified to bleaching or cnidarian bleaching, instead of coral bleaching. If these changes take place, the references should change. Present introduction literature is relevant.The structure of the manuscript follows the PeerJ templates. All figures are relevant, of sufficient resolution and properly described.                 The article originality is the use of student volunteers to assess, after training, the bleaching status of the zoantharian. This is based on the use of \"CoralWatch Coral Health Chart\" and the results obtained by Hibino et al. (2015).This manuscript presents an interesting research, however there are some parts that need to be rewritten, such as the objective and hypothesis (research question). These are not clearly stated. It is important for the authors to rewrite the paragraph that describes the scope of the study focusing it on cnidarian (zoantharian) bleaching.The description of the methods used is clear for other researchers to reproduce them. As stated by the authors, the zoantharian species is free from legal protections.                 The experimental design accomplish the PeerJ requirements, however the colour scoring data taken in 2014 is limited. The later, explain the results obtained (little predictive power) and the necessity for using the raw data from Hibino et al. (2013). The use of both data set as well as the data obtained in the laboratory support the conclusions regarding the zoantharian bleaching, however it does not to coral bleaching.             Comments:As mentioned before, the manuscript has to be modified and focused in cnidarian bleaching. Additionally, in the discussion the practical considerations should be extended.                                                ", "The article is generally well written and organized to the standards of Peer J.  This works is attempting to use &#8220;citizen science&#8221; approaches and methodologies combined with empirical data to make inferences about anthozoan bleaching.Introduction is mostly complete. I do not believe that the term &#8216;fingerprint&#8217; should be used throughout the manuscript to describe the qualitative assessment (from citizen scientists) of the bleaching status of the zoanthids. The general term &#8216;fingerprinting&#8217; includes methodologies that are well documented using genetic markers (DNA fingerprinting) or spectral analyses (Ecological fingerprinting). Both of these techniques use rigorous, and quantitative approaches that are widely accepted. I do not believe the proposed techniques used to &#8216;fingerprint&#8217; the biological status of zoanthids in this manuscript are of the same standard.The Introduction and Discussion should consider the findings of: Cruz et al. Marine Biology 2015.  White but not bleached: photophysiological evidence from white Montastraea cavernosa reveals potential overestimations of coral bleaching.                 See comments in &#8220;Basic Reporting&#8221; referring to the usage of the term &#8216;fingerprint&#8217;.Portions of this research are done quite rigorously and I find the results relevant and meaningful. For example, using Symbiodinium densities and Chl a measurments to compare colour scores is well done and demonstrates the amount of variation that can be associated with the &#8220;colour&#8221; of a anthozoan and the colour doesn&#8217;t represent the health status of the organisms (during most conditions). Suggest incorporating Cruz et al. 2015 throughout the manuscript.Furthermore, zoanthids are somewhat unique in that they incorporate and accrete large amounts of sediment (carbonate materials) into their tissue layers. How this the amount of particulates no doubt will influence light scattering and overall color of the organism. Therefore, overall color of zoanthids may not very informative on the overall physiological status of the organism; thus, zoanthids may not be very good indicator species for overall coral bleaching.The use of visually inspecting symbiont cell condition does not seem very informative. What exactly is being assessed and quantified? I am very skeptical of what cellular and biochemical information can be measured (without advanced staining and cellular probes) via microscopy.  At the minima photographs of what is deemed &#8220;healthy&#8221; or &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; Symbiodinium should be included as a figure. However, preservation techniques, isolation of Symbiodinium, and storage of samples will all influence how Symbiodinium cells &#8220;look&#8221;.Although I applaud incorporating undergraduates into a research and environmental monitoring program e.g. &#8220;Twelve undergraduate students from the University of the Ryukyus were trained as part of a two-day practical course using images of Palythoa tuberculosa and Symbiodinium sp. collected previously as part of a year-long monitoring project&#8221;. I do not see how they can become familiar enough with what healthy looking Symbiodinium cells are to accurately collect empirical data. The same is true with the color score tests.  Two days in a class room setting seems to be stretching the capabilities of the analyses.Typically how humans perceive the color of anthozoan has very little to do with the health status of the organism, with the exception of very bleached organisms. This work documents the variation associated with visual classifications. There seems to be some disagreement between some of the conclusions of this work. For example, &#8220;We found that P. tuberculosa colour score, although highly correlated among observers, provided little predictive power for the other variables. This was likely due to the overall healthy condition of the reef in midwinter. Nevertheless, when used in conjunction with baseline monitoring data, fingerprinting is an easy and robust means of assessing reef health as part of a larger conservation strategy.&#8221; These statements seem to contradict themselves.Additionally, comparing winter, non-stressful conditions, to other time points doesn&#8217;t seem very ecological relevant. A better strategy would be compare health summer conditions to stressful conditions. This would allow for more similar photoacclimation and seasonal acclimation of the Symbiodinium and zoanthids and comparisons to &#8220;bleached&#8221; conditions would be more accurate. An additional point of contridction was at Ln 242-244 where it is stated that &#8220;One major advantage of fingerprinting over monitoring individuals is that more volunteers can typically be included, sp losses in accuracy due to the involvement of many non-experts can be offset by averaging observations.&#8221; However, just in the next paragraph they state &#8220;Based on our fingerprinting data from January 2014, we found that colour scores did not predict more invasive metric values such as &#8230;&#8221;                 Due to some of the problems with the experimental design listed above (i.e. 2-days of student training to asses dinoflagellate &#8220;health&#8221; and coral color) and the comparison of winter acclimated versus summer &#8220;stressed&#8221; zoanthid colonies, I think many of the predictions are not sound. Furthermore, the variation in color scores alone should indicate that this way of monitoring zoanthids is likely not very valid. I like the attempt of incorporating citizen science into environmental monitoring, however, I believe that this paper does a poor job justifying this approach is a sufficient tool to do such.

The authors compare each read in the metagenome to the standard libraries, and then extract the environmental records associated with each of the sequences. They present those records as evidence of where the sequences likely came from.The manuscript describes the pipeline that they have developed, the approaches that they use, and the summary statististics that are generated. In addition, the manuscript includes two use cases that demonstrate the utility of this approach.                 There was a minor issue in downloading and installing the software - graphviz and the development version of graphviz needed to be installed before the pip install seqenv command would successfully complete.The approach that is used is to compare the sequences to  a standard database using BLAST. seqenv can handle parallelization of the BLAST search. This is not described but presumably it is via the number of threads option to the blast executable. However, BLAST is very slow and there are better search algorithms available these days (e.g. lastal, rapsearch2, diamond), and it would be useful to either accept one of the standard output formats that is (approximately) supported by those applications (e.g. tab-separated output) or to provide the search executable as an option to the seqenv program.                 seqenv represents a useful tool to summarize the environmental data associated with metagenomes, and will be useful as an exploratory tool to analyze the data.

The methodology appears sound and the manuscript is in general well written, with a very clear positioning of the approach relative to recent alternatives involving direct geolocation. The steps are laid out quite adequately in the methods section, with some good visuals supporting the explanation. Optional filtering to reduce execution time, the computational load perhaps being most troublesome in the BLAST based search step. It is not clear from the work presented whether the use of different BLAST parameters or much faster, lower sensitivity alternatives would have a significant effect on the resulting term calling. It would be a useful extension to this paper to explore this, as it is possible that the effect on accuracy of annotation may be modest relative to the performance gain. USearch is one such possibility. The software is well organised and readily available from the github site with detailed instructions. Installation for linux systems is straightforward and windows users can probably use a guest environment successfully, though I did not try this. It was not possible to assess the effectiveness of the NER work undertaken, though evidently the results are far from poor. I note the reliance on the earlier 2015 study which in its conclusions suggests just this application, but it would be nice to have some clearer idea of this part of the work. The case studies are well presented but the biological context is outside my expertise. The discussion of the normalisation alternatives is relatively light. At present, only simple approaches are employed, and there appears not to have been much effort to link this work to established ideas from information retrieval and related fields. While this work is a firm foundation, there may well be fruitful exploration possible in that direction.

The English is appropriate but needs to be revised, as I noticed several typos in the text. The manuscript, despite its main question is worth to be investigated, shows several limits and needs to be improved in many aspects. First of all, I don&#8217;t agree with the approach to use only field specimens to assess the quality of the two techniques: the field conditions, which are by definition unknown, are not ideal to evaluate the best method to assess the parity of the mosquitoes, as some unknown environmental/physiological factors could have affected the status of the ovaries. Moreover, the test is based on the assumption that the wet dissection is the gold standard but no justification are provided for this choice. The comparison of two techniques should be based on the postulation that one of the two is the best known approach in order to assess the outcome to be detected. The authors should provide bibliographic information to support their choice. Anyway, there are no sure information about the oviposition event of the field mosquitoes collected. The only added information could be the presence of sperm in the spermathaeca, which could give information about mating but no guarantees that an oviposition event happened or not. So, how the authors are sure that the mosquitoes were parous or nulliparous? An insectary study based on mosquitoes that have done single oviposition as positive control would have been a better approach. With the protocol adopted in this study it is impossible to determine the false positives and false negatives, which is the basis of the determination of sensitivity and specificity of a technique compared to another. For all these reasons, I strongly suggest to repeat the study also in insectary conditions in order to have a complete picture.Other comments:- in methods section it is not reported how concordance, specificity and sensitivity is calculated, please describe the formulas citing the appropriate references.- lines 192-193 (and also 250-251): it is not clear to me what is the aim of the comparison between Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles arabiensis performance of the techniques. What is adding this test to the manuscript? Moreover, the better quality of the former species is not based on objective evaluation and is not described how a reader could evaluate this quality in order to use this result for other studies. I suggest to better integrate this experiment or to remove it from the manuscript.- line 194: the numbers of A. arabiensis dissected here is 238, while in the abstract is reported 389 collected.

In table 1 is reported a total of 289 mosquitoes, while here 211 are reported. Please correct.- lines 206-212: This is a comment that should be moved into Discussion. Also, it could be interesting to specify how many nights of collection have been done, as the total number of mosquitoes should be 389. I suppose that the number of nights would be not more than 3-4. So, it is possible that the difference in parous rate is just due to a sampling bias.

The background was addressed appropriately, methods were described concisely and results presented in an easily understandable manner.There is one section which is difficult to follow and can be improved (see other comments to the author).                 The experiment was well designed and methods explained with sufficient detail to allow its replication. The comparison of the two methods presented is of importance to researchers and health authorities wanting to measure mosquito survival in the field and therewith evaluate the impact of vector control interventions. The rationale was well described in the introduction. Although dry dissections are considered \"easier\" the wet method has been thought to have higher accuracy. The results presented in this article indicate dry and wet dissections provide similar information in regard to parity status of a malaria mosquito. Ethics approval was sought.

Isn&#8217;t the presence of a sac just indicative that eggs have been laid recently? How can the length of the gonotrophic cycle be inferred from this observation? Line 204 One of the clear limitations of dissections is the level of dexterousness needed to perform the technique and the difficulty of standardizing the technique since it depends on each individual&#8217;s talent. Also, there is an arguable degree of subjectivity. This should be mentioned given that sensitivity and specificity of the technique will vary according to whoever is performing the dissections.Line 216 &#8220;Among 183 A. gambiae s.l. from Kyamyorwa identified to species by PCR 152 (83.1%) were A. arabiensis&#8221; What were the remaining 17%?Line 224 &#8220;Among the nulliparous insects, virgins survived better than those with mating plugs (Chi-Square 5.4373, p = 0.020).&#8221; Do the authors think there is a biological explanation to this finding?Line 231 &#8220;Hence, newly emerged insects were more likely to attempt to feed outdoors rather than indoors.&#8221; I believe this finding has been seen in other studies however there is no consensus why younger mosquitoes prefer to feed outdoors, do the authors have a theory? Is it relatable to &#8220;experience&#8221; of the vector? Do the authors think anophelines can learn and remember? I think this is a very interesting topic that isn&#8217;t discussed enough. Perhaps the authors would like to share their hypothesis backed up by their data.Line 234 &#8220;Among parous insects the proportion with &#8216;a&#8217; sacs was significantly greater in insects that were dead&#8221; So is this indicative that females that have recently oviposited are more fragile and likely to die than others?

Literature cited left the author to conclude that they were the first group to use both dried and wet preparations to determine age in anophelines.

Well presented.  The only flaw in the work, is that they really don't know which method is the gold standard.  The senior author [a well respected expert] selected the wet method based on his experience.  It may have been useful to prepare a known set of standards similar to Hugo et al.

This was addressed statistically on L204-205.             Comments:As discussed by the authors, estimates of parity and therefore survivorship can be biased by the collection methods used, time specimens were held and source of the material dissected.  The authors did not discuss the impact of the pregravid blood meal on using the dry method.  Here, the small blood meal often taken by virgin females in lieu of sugar advances the ovarioles to Stage IIa and this yolk can make it difficult to see the tracheoles.  It also is important to understand the ecology of the species.  Some anopheles rest indoors but egress to feed outdoors; they also oviposit and refeed the same night, and rapidly transition from sacculate to dilation.  If they fail to find a blood meal the same night, they will appear parous but not sacculate the following evening.

As mentioned previously, this is just an improved version of a previous manuscript from 2014 (Olmos et al., 2014 in Genome announcement). No relevant conclusions were build up from this manuscript. I miss comparison of strain MP2 with those published by Tamarit et al., 2015 This would add more information about the MP2 strain.The manuscript accomplish the ethic standards of the field.                 Reviewers do not have access to genome data, so no way to confirm the findings.Conclusions are just a recap of the results from the genome with speculations about the functions of group of genes found in the strain MP2. Part of these results have been published previously by Olmos et al., 2014.The main finding of the manuscript is the obtention of a complete genome from MP2, solving few aspects that were not possible to conclude from the draft genome, but the main aspects were already published and comment in previous works.             Comments:I consider that this is a good beginning for a interesting manuscript. However, the unique improvement from previous works is just having the complete genome without further relevant information.To my opinion, this manuscript would need further experimentation to contain new and further findings in order to be relevant.                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.7187": ["There are a number of issues with the reporting of the results of the study: (1) title: the title needs to refer to Atlantic bluefin tuna(2) abstract: the first sentence needs to be refer to Atlantic bluefin tuna. Also, the abstract does not explain why it is important to know whether spawning occurs in Mexican waters (e.g. the importance of this information for fisheries management); the abstract needs a concluding sentence; (2) line 42: explain the meaning of ICCAT; (3) lines 51-52: there needs to be some more biological background to the sentence (i.e. it suggests that the tuna migrate into Mexican waters but no information on migration pathways is provided in the Introduction, therefore the relevance of knowing this information is not obvious); (4) the Introduction does not conclude with statements about why the information collected by this study is needed or important;(5) some of the information in some figures is unclear: Fig 1 (what is the darker blue shading?), Fig 2 (the units of length on the X-axis are missing); Fig 5 (what types of error bars are shown?);(6) lines 83-105: the descriptions of the ovarian stages would be better represented as a table rather than text in a paragraph.                 I have 3 concerns about the experimental design that cast doubt on the validity of some of the study&#8217;s findings and conclusions:(1) The study used fish that had been caught as by-catch in the fishery for another species of tuna in only a single season. As a result, only a small number of fish were studied, with histological evidence coming from 46 fish in one year. The sampling will not address the possibility of year-to-year variation in timing of spawning, and the sample size is substantially smaller than other recent studies of tuna spawning e.g. Ashida and Horie (2015) used 438 skipjack tuna; Farley et al (2015) used 640 southern bluefin tuna, and Okochi et al (2016) used 1040 Pacific bluefin tuna. The small sample sizes, and the limited spatial extent of the sampling do not provide sufficient information about the relative importance of spawning by this species in Mexican waters.(2) The conclusion that the southern area of the Gulf of Mexico is &#8216;a new possible spawning area&#8217; cannot be justified because sampling was not done extensively enough to show that this area is sufficiently distant from the spawning area in the northern Gulf of Mexico i.e. there could be a single large spawning area that covers the entire Gulf of Mexico. The data in the study only show that spawning appears to occur in Mexican waters.(3) Sampling occurred only between January and April. Therefore the study&#8217;s conclusion #1 (line 160) that there is a &#8216;marked seasonal occurrence&#8217; is not justified. The results show that the species was present for the months sampled but there is no data to show that the species was not present in other months.Overall, the study provides some preliminary evidence that suggests Atlantic Bluefin tuna spawn in Mexican waters.                 Covered in previous comments             Comments:This manuscript reports the results of a study into the reproductive status of Atlantic bluefin tuna in Mexican waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Fish were collected, as by-catch of the yellowfin tuna fishery, over 4 months in one year and their maturity and gonad state assessed histologically. While i can foresee the need and importance of this study, it was not suitably described in the text. The authors made a number of conclusions about from the limited data set on the timing of migration, the existence of a previously unreported spawning area, and the timing of spawning. The study was undertaken in a scientific manner; however the limited number of samples, and the spatial and temporal extents of the sampling, make this a preliminary study and do not sufficiently justify the authors&#8217; conclusions.                                                ", "in the Introduction section, it is missing some more details about why this area has been previously considered as potential spawning area for bluefin tuna (Abad-Uribarren et al. 2014), for example the occurrence of this species and suitable spawning window related to shift/evolution of oceanographic condition (More details in the attached document).                 Overall, very few samples and few months were sampled (More details in the attached document).                 The obtained results can show a posible new spawning area in southern Gulf of Mexico, as it is noted in the title of the MS. However, the few individuals analyzed it weak point of this study and thus requires to be cautious in the conclusions.             Comments:The MS #33905 &#8211; &#8220;A possible new spawning area for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus): First histologic evidence of reproductive activity in southern Gulf of Mexico&#8221; provides information on bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) ovary morphology in different reproductive stages in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The investigation is primarily focused on microscopic analysis to assess the reproductive development of ovaries and testes. According to the knowledge of this reviewer, the classification methodology used for microscopic analysis is correct but certain concepts in the classification method should be clarified. But the main concern is the low number of samples analyzed and especially those in spawning that finally support the evidence that bluefin tuna conduct spawning activity in the area proposed. Overall, the article is written in clear English, unambiguous, and it is a technically correct text. The article has conformed to professional standards of courtesy and expression, although certain clarification is required in the Material and Methods section. Overall, the article is concise and to the point and although the context of the study is well set and it includes sufficient literature references, there are missing some more details in the introduction and discussion section about why this area has been previously considered as potential spawning area for bluefin tuna (Abad-Uribarren et al. 2014), for example the occurrence of this species and suitable spawning window related to shift/evolution of oceanographic condition. In the opinion of the reviewer, this will better set the context/rationale of the study and the comparison with northern spawning areas, more than just the observations of different spawning areas in the Mediterranean Sea. The relevance and usefulness of the figure 2 and 5 it is not clear. In contrast figure 1, 3 and 4 and tables 1 and 2 are relevant for the content of the article.More details about above mentioned are described below:INTRODUCTION:As mentioned previously, in the Introduction section, it is missing some more details about why this area has been previously considered as potential spawning area for bluefin tuna (Abad-Uribarren et al. 2014), for example the occurrence of this species and suitable spawning window related to shift/evolution of oceanographic condition. In the opinion of the reviewer, this will better set the context/rationale of the study and the comparison with northern spawning areas, more than just the observations of different spawning areas in the Mediterranean Sea.MATERIAL AND METHODSThe classification method applied to define mature from immature individuals is not clear and further clarification is required. The authors stated that &#8220;females were classified as mature if ovaries contained vitellogenic, MG or HY oocytes and/or atresia&#8221;. However, it is not described which stage of vitellogenesis (early or advance) set the limit. As it is written, it seems that E-Vit is delimiting the threshold between immature/mature, and this is not what Schaefer (1998) and Farley et al. (2013) described in their studies. In both papers presence of A-Vit oocytes was the evidence of mature or active females (in Farley et al. 2013 and Schaefer 1998, respectively). This also contribute to the confusion when in line 84 it is defined as developing, ovaries contained E-Vit oocytes as MAGO. According to the line 82-83 these are mature individuals. A table with histological classification criteria similar to Table 2 presented in Farley et al., 2013 is recommended. This table will also help authors defining the % of atresia used to determine the sexual maturity as it was done in Farley et al. (2013) and Schaefer (1998). Lines 83-84 and 96-97 seem to be more result and should be moved to corresponding section.RESULTSIn lines 114-117 I would suggest including number of individuals, as having only the % does not show the few number of individuals analyzed and this information is important for the interpretation of the results and how strength of the conclusions. In line 114 change &#8220;a few&#8230;&#8221; to one individual. There is only one individual in developing according to the table 1. In line 117 also add how many (n=1) individuals were found at spawning. Authors did not note if POF were present in analyzed ovaries. I would suggest adding information in this respect as if there were found could better support the hypothesis of a new spawning area in southern Gulf of Mexico.Table 1 and 2. Could the authors provide the reason to divide the months in early, mid and late periods? How can this improve the analysis of the samples?There is missing (probably in the Discussion section) the interpretation of the different maturity stages found in female and male BFT along the months analyzed and its relation with the reproductive cycle of this species. 45% of the individuals are in regenerating stage in the months previous to the individuals found spawning capable and spawning stages. DISCUSSIONIn the first paragraph of this section (lines 127-134) the authors support the arrival of the bluefin tuna to the study region by the timing of the catch. But also, due to increased feeding behavior before the spawning season, however, this study does not provide any evidence (e.g., stomach content data) to support this statement or literature references of previous studies where feeding behavior of bluefin tuna was described and thus support the hypothesis that bluefin tuna arrive to the area between January and March to increase feeding before the spawning season.In paragraph two (lines 135-139) could be further develop the point described in Abad-Uribarren et al. 2014 where the suitable thermal and productive condition is related to potential bluefin tuna reproductive activity. And then compare with the conditions found in the northern Gulf of Mexico during the same period.In paragraph tree (lines 140-155) and specially in lines (146-150) the authors consider as new spawning area the southern Gulf of Mexico based on the data analyzed. I would suggest to be more conservative in the statement considering there is only one female in spawning and that there was not found other spawning markers in other ovaries from January to April.CONCLUSION:Considering the few individuals analyzed and the only one female in spawning found in the study I would start the section with the last proposed sentence &#8220;Additional studies are needed &#8230;&#8221; and then &#8220;However&#8230; in the present study four facts provide evidence for considering&#8230;&#8221;. And again I would be very cautious in the fourth point as only one female was found in spawning and there were not found any other spawning markers such as POF that could better support the spawning activity of bluefin tuna in the southern Gulf of Mexico.                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.5440": ["General,The paper reports an experiment done to measure metabolic activity in adipose depots of rats.  English is clearly not the first language of the authors,  but it is basically acceptable.  There are a few rough constructs that I have pointed out.   Unfortunately   the  bigger issues are that the authors clearly do not know the literature,  the truly massive and thorough literature on adipose tissue metabolism.  A review published in 1980 (yes 1980,  38 years ago) in Progess in Lipid Research listed over 400 papers in adipose tissue metabolism,  JUST IN RUMINANTS.  There were hundreds more in rats.  Finally,  the completely incomprehensible statement of objectives precludes any ability to understand what they were doing and it was made even less understandable when the methods were given,  which were absolutely inadequate to review as to what was actually done.

Epidydimal fat pads?  Inguinal fat pads? L 197 to 110  (the objective or hypothesis)  I am very sorry to say but this is totally undefinable&#8230;it is impossible to tell what in fact the objective(s) or hypothesis(es) was or were.  &#8216;which was the possible balance between the defining characteristics and relative metabolic uniformity&#8221;.Balance between characteristics?Balance between a characteristic and a metabolic activity?What is a &#8216;relative metabolic uniformity&#8217;  and how can it be compared to anything else?What is a &#8216;defining characteristic&#8217;  (anatomical location,  fat cell size  time of day&#8230;.) L 111.    &#8216;influence of sex was included in the equation&#8221;  what equation?  Sex or gender? This alone makes the work unable to be reviewed. It is impossible to know what you were testing.

Glucose, lactate, glycerol and NEFA were measured on what?  With what sampling technique?  On the cells?  In the medium?  Both?  L 175 to 178,  as expected from the nebulous statement of objective, there is no clear statement of experimental design or statistical analysis.  What &#8216;groups&#8217;  were compared and to what?  Once the authors determine what their objectives and hypotheses were, and what treatments were applied and what was measured to test those objectives and hypothesis,  they will need to clearly and explicitly state the statistical model used, including the proper error terms. L 239-241, this is a massive assumption, as likely as it may be..without actually measuring incorporation.   But release G3p from lipolysis could be reesterified. L 244 there is absolutely no basis for this statement,  without knowing the physiological and nutritional state of the animals when they were killed.  If they were in energy and carbon balance  it is obviousl that lipogenesis would be minimal, and in short term incubations there would not be sufficient time to induce all the enzymes and pathways to make significant amounts of fatty acids.  You cannot use one set of animals in an undefined state to make such an inference. L 255  same comment as above,   the change in expression cannot absolutely predict the change in metabolic rate&#8230;it can only be supportive or consistent. L 275 to 282,  all of this is not surprising at all given what has been published many times on the amounts and transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of these enzymes  which precludes a usual tight relationships (high CC or RSQ) between mRNA and activity. L 305 to 309.  This study does nothing of the sort,  and unfortunately this paragraph simple demonstrates the authors &#8216;ignorance&#8217; (and that is meant in the strict definition of the term..they clearly are not aware of the body of knowledge on WAT metabolism).   Without sounding like a snide old man,  it is likely that many of the authors were born after most of the work was done.   Much of this would be found in works conducted from the 1960&#8217;s (or earlier) through the early 1980s.   But to say &#8216;studies analyzing metabolic pathways are too few and incomplete to support it.  Sir Hans Krebs, Veech, Per Belfrage, C. Holm, R. Vernon,  D. Bauman, , RL Baldwin,  R. Prior,  Metz and Van den bergh, Abraham, Edwin Krebs,  Katz, McNamara, Loor, etc&#8230;&#8230;.might disagree with you.  I stopped reading here.   There is no way that they can possibly know glucose uptake or lactate uptake or output or NEFA or glycerol uptake given what they stated that they measured,  as they did not state that they measured anything specifically in cells or media.  AND in the absence of using some kind of radio or mass label,  or measuring over time (0 minutes to XX minutes of incubation) how could they possibly know that &#8216;uptake&#8217; and &#8216;release&#8217; occurred compared to just recycling? I think the authors collected much useful data and it would be nice to be published.

This study was done in cell culture, which does not contain mature adipose structure, and also the cell composition is different. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that adipocytes in vivo have similar changes observed in cultured cells.Figure 2. It will be better to label significant difference in bars. Also, the variations for data of most figures were very small, which appeared unlikely for biological replicates. Do you use cell from individual animals and individual animal was considered as an experimental unit? These need to be added into the statistic section.Figure 3 to 6.

"], "10.7717/peerj.2385": ["The paper is reasonably well written and includes an introduction based on a large number of previous and recent studies to demonstrate how the work fits into the broader field of knowledge. The authors provide a rationale in the Introduction by showing that a problem exists about the phytotoxicity of some biochars, and that there is little information regarding the source and chemistry of toxics involved. However, the quality of the paper decreases because of the results, figures and tables (not well labeled and described) that are sometimes difficult to understand.                 The aim of the paper is clear and the authors define enough well as to how the study contributes to filling the knowledge gap about the potential cause for null and negative plant of biochar on species. In particular, the authors applied five dosages of the biochars (0, 5, 10, 20, 50 t/ha) to a soil as direct surface applications and as complete soil mixes. Moreover, the authors examined the effects of leaching and heating treatments on biochar and studied the mobile organic compounds by SPME-GC-MS to identify candidate molecules involved in toxicity responses. However, the authors do not describe the methods with sufficient information to be reproducible by another investigator.                 The results of experiment 1 and 2 are unclear and it is difficult understanding whether the conclusions are appropriately stated and the analysis of the data was well executed.             Comments:In the present paper entitled &#8220;Thermal treatment and leaching biochar alleviates plant growth inhibition from mobile organic compounds&#8221;, Gale et al. tested the effects of three different biochars on two common forage crop species (Lolium multiflorum and Trifolium repens). Moreover, the authors studied the molecules involved in toxicity responses by SPME-GC-MS. The paper is relatively interesting because now there are several studies demonstrating phytotoxicity to fresh biochar, but there is little information regarding the source and chemistry of toxics involved. However, the results are presented in a less understandable form and the discussion is partly weak. For example, the results of experiment 1 (negative and null effects on plant&#8230;) are average of three biochars? BC (line 321) is SB, MB, MFT or average of three biochar? Moreover, I did not fully understand why you used only MFT biochar for experiment 2 (modulation of effects through leaching and heating treatments) and analyzed by SPME-GC-MS the SB and MB biochars to study the organic compounds in biochars and in the water leachates.

This test can help to understand better the results.With respect to biochars, authors should improve the characterisation of the biochar. For example, I recommend follow the guidelines of the International Biochar Initiative and also it will be very useful to include the proximate analysis (fixed carbon, volatile matter, ash content).Also, authors should be explained better the choice of pyrolisis conditions. Indeed, could be pyrolysis temperature related with the composision of mobile compounds?According to that, authors should improve the discussion about the properties of different biochars.                 Authors conclude  \"Our results strong suggest that mobile organic compounds from BC were responsible for this growth inhibition (primarily organic acids and phenols), as heating and leaching BC before application alleviated this negative response and addition of leachates alone replicated the negative responses observed.\" and that results are contrary to \"overall trend of positive plant growth responses presented in recent meta-analyses\".I am agree with  the conclusions, but these conclusions are for these biochars and probably for other biochars or other soil the results will be different. Authors must support better this idea incluiding the type of biochar that has had negative or positive effect in plant growth in the cited papers.

However, I have several suggestions for improving the quality of the manuscript further.1. The review of the current face matching literature in the introduction is rather sparse and could be more comprehensive. For example, some key studies are missing from the introduction that set the context of the study, such as Burton et al.&#8217;s (2010) work with the GFMT showing baseline accuracy rates of 80% as a best-case scenario, and White et al.&#8217;s (2014) work with passport officers. Likewise, there is room for discussion of within-person variability in relation to Experiment 2 (see, e.g., Fysh &amp; Bindemann, 2018; Megreya et al., 2013), and how this impacts face matching performance.2. In the General Discussion (Lines 486-487), the authors write that &#8220;children&#8217;s faces are more homogenous than adult faces, displaying lower levels of between-face variability.&#8221; This is a logical point, but difficult to reconcile with the findings of Experiment 3 &#8211; if infant faces are homogenous, then couldn&#8217;t we logically expect a response bias in the direction of classifying faces as the same identity, rather than as different?3. Would it be possible to also provide an example mismatch trial for the Infant-Infant matching task?4. The link between Experiments 1 and 2 is not explicitly stated, although the rationale is straightforward. A few lines at the end of the discussion for Experiment 1 to introduce the motivation for Experiment 2 would help clarify this.5. There is little discussion of the findings of Experiment 2. These could be contextualised in line with the current face matching literature (e.g., within-person variability).                 The research question is timely and relevant to face matching in practical settings such as passport control. There is clear value in understanding the extent to which child and infant photographs can be accurately matched. However, I find some aspects of the current experimental design to be problematic. These concerns are specified in further detail below. 1. For Experiment 3, the authors note that they did not restrict themselves to same-sex pairings for mismatch trials in the infant-infant and infant-child matching tasks (Line 373). If this is the case, why are differences between same-sex and different-sex pairings not reported as they are in Experiments 1 and 2? In general, this consistent aspect of the design across experiments is problematic, given that this introduces a clear distinction between match (always same-sex) and mismatch trials (sometimes same-sex), and it isn&#8217;t clear as to why the researchers chose to construct their mismatch trials in this way.2. In line with the above point &#8211; given that the trial types are so different here, I do not think that it is appropriate to collapse accuracy across match and mismatch trials when analysing performance. Instead, Experiment 3 would be far more informative if the data were analysed via a 2 (trial: match vs. mismatch) x 3 (matching task: infant-infant vs. infant-child vs. GFMT) repeated measures ANOVA. 3. I also have some further concerns about the selection criteria used for stimuli in Experiment 3, namely that items in the new infant-infant and infant-child matching tasks were based on by-item accuracy from Experiments 1 and 2. If my understanding of the first two experiments is correct, then this means that for each match trial, 30 data points were available, but only 1 data point was available per mismatch trial because these were randomly generated for each participant. Is this correct? If so, then these seem to be rather loose criteria for selection of mismatching stimuli to be included in the final test. 4. In Experiment 3, it is reported that 37 participants were recruited, and then in the results it is reported that data from three participants was excluded, with the analysis being based on the remaining 37 participants. This detail should be amended and/or clarified in the &#8216;Participants&#8217; section of Experiment 3.                 The findings are interesting and novel. Considered together, this research suggests that it is extremely challenging to match images of two infants (Experiment 1), as well as infant-to-child photographs (Experiment 2), and that these are notably more difficult than matching two (highly optimised) images of adults (Experiment 3). There are some caveats to this work that should be addressed, however, and there is room to extend these findings further. Again, suggestions for improving the current set of results are provided below.1. The researchers should consider including some reliability measures for the infant-infant and infant-child matching tasks (e.g., Cronbach's alpha or Split-Half Reliability).2. In general, the sample sizes are rather small across all experiments, and differences between the construction of the tasks used makes it difficult to assess whether the results are actually replicating between Experiments 1 and 2 to Experiment 3. It would be worth re-running Experiment 3 with a greater number of participants to replicate the main findings (i.e. that infant-infant and infant-child matching is more difficult than matching adult faces), as well as clarify the marginal findings (e.g., correlations between tests), which may have been unstable due to the low sample sizes (e.g., Sch&#246;nbrodt &amp; Perugini, 2013). 3. The researchers may also want to consider examining how accuracy for infant-infant and infant-child matching relates to additional, more difficult tests of face matching (e.g., Kent Face Matching Test, Model Face Matching Test, Good Bad Ugly Face Test, etc.).4. In Experiment 1, why was accuracy compared to performance in the GFMT as found by Bobak, Dowsett, et al. (2016), as opposed to Burton et al. (2010)? Likewise, why is performance in Experiment 2 also not compared to GFMT levels of accuracy?             Comments:In general, this research explores an important set of questions and I would like to see the findings published, following some revisions. I hope that the suggestions that are supplied here will be of some value moving forward with the manuscript.

The design is largely computational, and I believe it is suitable and critically performed. More detail is in my comments for the authors.                 I believe the criteria for meeting the standards were met by these authors, and that the validity of the data is sound.             Comments:This is a very interesting and timely study of predominantly structural 3&#8217;UTR cis elements that share common locations in mRNAs that encode functionally related proteins during growth and development of T. cruzi. The cis mRNA binding sites for trans-acting factors such as RNA-binding proteins and noncoding RNAs represent a platform for the combinatorial codes of RNA regulons. The authors have used available tools to devise an algorithm (flow chart) of discovery of coordinated mRNA subpopulations. Among the key aspects of this work is that computational tools to discern RNA structural elements were applied here and yielded new and exciting information that is directly applicable to known metabolic pathways in T. cruzi (and are conserved in other trypanosome species as well). Thus, the data take a very different approach to the elucidation of RNA regulons in this organism, many of which reach have reached very similar conclusions. However, this not only confirms other potential RNA regulons, but also reveals several new potential examples. In total, trypansomes are quickly emerging as the best studied and best understood biological system in which RNA regulons dominate the outcomes of gene expression. This paper greatly extends this evidence and our understanding of gene expression that is applicable to other species.Suggestions:1.\tI would like to see a more in-depth discussion (a few sentences) about how advanced methods for determining higher-order RNA structure are lacking but that reliable one exist for secondary structural analysis. In spite of this limitation, the authors are able to apply these available methods to demonstrate common secondary structural elements among mRNA subsets. As methods for predicting tertiary and higher-order RNA structures improve they are likely to reveal many more examples of global RNA coordination though combinatorial cis-trans interactions. The lack of advanced methods of RNA structural analysis is also a partial explanation for why it may not be possible at this time to readily elucidate RNA regulons in more of the 53 KEGG groups. But the algorithm in figure 1a may be applicable for this in future years as well. In this sense, this paper is pioneering.2.\tWith respect to motif enrichment, the numbers are impressive. But I am surprised that there are very few (15%) cis-acting structural motifs in 5&#8217;UTRs. This is consistent with the fact in other species that most regulation of mRNA stability tends to involve 3&#8217;UTRs, but 5&#8217; structures are often important for translational regulation. Alternatively, this may suggest that RNA regulons, in general, tend to involve 3&#8217; UTRs. Do the authors believe this is characteristic of trypansomes more than other species?3.\tThere is a repeated sentence at line 198 on page 7.4.\tPage 13 line 376: Use of the terms &#8220;motifs&#8221;, is unclear. It seems to me that &#8220;four motifs&#8221; should be changed to something like &#8220;four hallmarks&#8221; or &#8220;four criteria&#8221;, or? But it confuses the other meaning of the word motif in the paper. 5.\tFigure 4: this needs more explanation. Please give a clearer interpretation of the probability density function. What is the trend of these distributions and what is the basis for assigning the 175 nucleotide spot? Do the low frequency numbers at 300 and 340 in figure 4a indicate a declining trend toward a boundary? Is there a boundary at the stop codon?6.\tFigure 5 is very convincing and similar to other RNA regulon heatmaps (e.g. Hogan, Brown et al., PLoS Biology 2008). However, Cluster II is a bit unclear. What do the authors mean by &#8220;more broad distributed elements&#8221; (P. 8 line 223)? Are these interpreted as not being RNA regulons?7.\tFigures 6 and 7 are excellent and really drive the points home.

Comments:This is an interesting study that compares anti-Bd bacterial isolates from frogs in nature with frogs in captivity.  Some of the comparisons are based on previously published data from a study that used different conditions in captivity.  However, the overall result is that frogs had anti-Bd isolates in captivity to the same degree as in nature.  Thus, there appeared to be no reduction in &#8220;defensive function&#8221; for frogs in captivity.  Of course, for these frogs, anti-Bd function needs to be enhanced for them to survive in nature, but at least anti-Bd function does not seem to decline in captivity.Were the captive animals collected from the same populations as the populations sampled in nature?The authors can highlight the point that although bacterial community structure changed in captivity, the predicted anti-Bd function remained intact.  This suggests that selection has acted on bacterial community function (eg., antifungal activity and protection) as opposed to selection for specific community structures.In Figure 2, at least for limosus and spurrelli, it appears that there is considerable overlap in bacterial species.  There is lower diversity on the wild animals, but those OTUs appear to be present in captivity. In line 220, I suggest a rewording.  There was actually high overlap, by the alpha and beta diversity differed.More details on the conditions in captivity would be helpful (L 119).

Statements such as \"...allow us to predict that these individuals will be protected against the pathogen if released in the wild\" are at best misplaced, at worst dangerous. On no account should reintroduction of amphibians be encouraged without knowing detailed information on the complex relationship between host, pathogen, microbiota, and ecology, which can be dictated by not only the bacterial composition on individual, and within populations of amphibians, but also by the interactions between and within amphibian and microbial communities, which themselves can differ from one population to the next, even if the species composition does not alter.The presence of Bd-resistant bacteria and/or anti-Bd activity does not confer host, species, or population resistance.             Comments:This is an interesting study that sheds light on the differences that may be observed in skin microbiota between captive and wild amphibians.

It took me some time to understand what they did, with constant flipping forth and back between tables, figures and text. I do not mean to say that a lot of additional words are needed. But for instance:- it would be good in the figure caption to repeat again how these data were obtained (some wording such as &#8220;culture-based&#8221; or &#8220;cultured isolates&#8221; would already help. - in the first section of the Results, it would be good to include some summary statistics also about the genera (to how many bacterial &#8220;species&#8221; =OTUs did the cultured bacteria belong and to how many genera (and the number of genera then should probably agree with those in Fig. 2, if I interpreted that graph correctly.

C. et al. 2015 Antifungual isolates database of amphibian skin-associated bacteria and function against emerging fungal pathogens. Ecology 96, 595.) is not cited here. I strongly suggest the authors make an effort to integrate not only this paper, but to compare their data with that database (number of inhibitory isolates per genus / how many of their antifungal bacteria species are already includedin the database and were they also in previous studies identified as inhibitory? And so on. I would even suggest that the results of this study should also be submitted to that data base. At least, the authors should present the original data of their inhibition experiments for each strain in a supplementary table, making future integration into the Woodhams database easier, and thereby making their data more directly available to the scientific and conservation community.The following is a series of minor points for revision, which however is not complete.

Applied and Environmental Microbiology 81: 6589-6600.) it is clear that in your approach, you have only been able to isolate a fraction of the OTUs that are present on your toads (as obvious from NGS-amplicon-based approaches that regularly identify many more OTUs). Acknowledging this uncertainty is important, aand this should happen much earlier in the Discussion. Statements such as &#8220;Our results showed that ex situ conditions are not reducing the diversity of skin bacteria or the proportion of anti-Bd bacteria;&#8221; are clearly overstatements and must be avoided.

The current implementation is based on the following steps: i) normalizing the data within [0, 1], ii) checking for minimum and maximum threshold levels, iii) fitting a sigmoidal and double sigmoidal model by maximum likelihood (nonlinear least-squares) using the minpack.lm package and a grid of starting estimates for robustness, and finally iv) model selection based on lowest AIC. This algorithm is tested by an extensive simulation regime, in which increasing noise is added to perfect sigmoidal/double sigmoidal models (&#8220;ground truth&#8221;). It could be demonstrated that with the exception of extremely high noise levels, the implementation succeeds in identifying the underlying true model.The manuscript is well-written and the package works well, however there are some important points the authors should address before rendering it suitable for publication.1)\tIt is not really clear - and nowhere mentioned - in which scenario (biological, pharmaceutical or clinical question) the selection between sigmoids/double sigmoids is essential. This information (maybe discriminating growth from growth with subsequent decay) should be supplied in the &#8220;Introduction&#8221;; else, the readership will see no real-world application.2)\tAIC is not explained and not written in unabbreviated form.3)\tWhen drawing the starting parameters from a uniform distribution (line 49), does it make sense to draw random values from it? Functions such as runif might miss some essential values. Would it not be better to create a sequence from within this window, i.e. seq(lower, upper, length.out = 100) to ensure that the complete parameter space is employed?4)\tThe authors should at least verify that the quality of model selection is also achieved when i) the predictor values are not an equidistant sequence (3 to 30, in 0.5 increments) and ii) the noise setup is heteroscedastic, i.e. noise is a function of the magnitude. This must not necessarily be included as a figure, but the outcome would be interesting as most of the real-world data does not have constant (homoscedastic) noise.5)\tIt would also be interesting to know how the model selection performs when the authors use a 5-parameter (Richards) sigmoidal model, which often fits better when the curve is asymmetric.6)\tIn lines 172ff, the authors describe a decreasing performance of model selection in a high-noise regime. In this context, the authors should cite the work from Spiess &amp; Neumeyer (https://bmcpharma.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2210-10-6), which investigated model sigmoidal model selection and resulting goodness-of-fit measures at varying noise levels.7)\tI strongly believe that Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 could be merged into one concise Figure, i.e. the different phases of the double-sigmoid could be denoted in Fig. 2B.8)\tThe authors have completely neglected the drc package, which also offers a wealth of functionality for sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting and model selection.

There are several R packages that should be mentioned: drc, drfit, grofit, qpcr, some of which are mentioned in the later subsection in lines 188-205; these lines should be integrated into the introduction. Note that the R package \"drc\", which can also fit biphasic patterns just like the proposed double sigmoidal model, is widely used for analysis for many different types of data.2) There are several claims throughout the manuscript that would need to be substantiated by suitable references, e.g., lines 21-23, 25-26, 64 (Why these thresholds?), 132 (Fermi?), 159-160 (Any reference for this definition as it's an unusual definition. Usually such a range would be defined based on a range on the y axis, e.g., EC5 to EC95).3) Definitions and methods are placed in the Results section. Please consider re-arranging parts of the material in the manuscript, e.g., lines 107-164 should be placed in the Methods section.

The manuscript addresses the problem of fitting high-throughput s-shaped data by providing an R package that allows classification of such data into 4 categories (including two types of nonlinear patterns) depending on the signal in the data. This is an interesting but also challenging problem.Moreover, it seems that a novel multiplicative double sigmoidal model has been proposed although there could be links to models for independent action of mixtures.However, some claims should be omitted: In lines 123, 132 it's claimed that any sigmoidal curve is fully determined by 3 parameters. This is simply not correct in general. There exist both four and five-parameter models for s-shaped data. Please look into the literature on logistic or log-logistic models. Actually, the authors define a four-parameter model in the appendix! Confusing.In lines 59-60: Perhaps I don't understand, but why should the AIC be larger than -10? Depending on the data AIC can take on arbitrary values I believe. A sensible rationale (a reference?) need to be supplied for such a non-standard rule.It would also be helpful if the authors could specify the probability distribution that is assumed when fitting models using maximum likelihood (line 47). Is it least squares estimation?                 The proposed R package performs as would be expected: the more noise the more difficult the classification.

"], "10.7717/peerj.1403": ["In general the manuscript conforms to basic formatting expectations, but there are a few aspects of the presentation of the material that could be improved:1. The Introduction would benefit from some revision: it is confusing in some places and simply not very informative in others.  Specifically, the paragraph from 64-86 that provides an overview of the higher taxonomy of Hydroidolina is quite confusing. It's not clear if the clades that are mentioned have been recognized (and received support) based on morphology alone, molecular analyses, or some combination of the two. Siphonophorae is first stated to be a well-supported monophyletic clade (67), but several sentences later (74) it's listed as a clade within Anthoathecata.  78-79 states that Aplanulata is a well-supported clade but that it includes members of Capitata, which has also just been referred to as a clade.  Clarifying what clades have been established based on morphological evidence, and have subsequently held up (or not) to molecular analysis might help make this paragraph easier to follow.   Further down in the Introduction there are two paragraphs that don't really serve much obvious function.  96-103 states that we now have the ability to use whole mt genomes for phylogenetic inference but doesn't include any information about why this approach might be more useful for phylogenetic inference than single-gene (or nuclear gene) approaches... And 104-112 posits that there are challenges to sequencing linear genomes, but doesn't indicate specifically what those are (presumably getting the ends of the sequences by PCR?) or how they have been or can be overcome.2. The Figure legends and Table titles could be more informative than they are. Some figure elements and abbreviations are not defined.  Some examples:  - Fig. 2 refers to \"light\" arrows, but not to the red and blue arrows that are shown.  - No mention is made of the light green chevrons that are in Figs 1 and 2 - what do they signify?   - What is \"cox1 c\" in Fig 1D?  - The text references a clade called \"Gonoproxima\" which is not indicated in Fig. 3. - Table 1 does not state where vouchers are housed, or what \"Notes\" means (the SRR numbers are referred to at several points in the text, but what do they signify)? - In Table 3, Start/Stop codons are given as e.g. A/A.  Does that mean ATG/ATA? What does \"NA\" mean (clade not recovered? clade not supported?)?   3. The Results section is uneven. Some results that should be described in the text are glossed over and the reader is left to figure things out from the figures, while other information that is adequately presented in Tables is unnecessarily repeated in the text.  Paragraph 202-217 is just a list of which species had the same gene orders, but doesn't tell the reader what those gene orders are or how they differ from one another.  The reader has to figure that out from Fig.1.  And one genome is stated to be \"novel\" and \"transitional\" but what about it makes it those things is not described.  Rather than simply listing what species have the same gene arrangements, it would be much more informative to describe how the arrangements differ from one another.  A Table might be a more efficient way to then list which species have which arrangement.  Conversely, the information given in paragraph 229-238 is all summarized in Table 2, and doesn't need to be repeated in the text (although see note above about defining abbreviations).  It's adequate just to state that some genes used alternative start and stop codons, and refer the reader to the table for the specific information about which ones.                 The methods used here to sequence and bioinformatically infer mt genomes were varied, but seem fairly straightforward. The Abstract, however, highlights the fact that \"we describe a new, relatively cheap and accessible multiplexing strategy...\" But this new method is described entirely within a Supplement to the manuscript.  If this is a novel enough protocol to highlight in the Abstract, shouldn't it be described within the main body of the paper?                 The findings fall into three separate categories:  1. Inference of mt genome maps.  2. Use of the nt and AA sequence data to infer phylogenetic relationships.  3. Speculation about the mechanism of mt gene transcription in Hydrozoa.  I have no concerns about the analysis and interpretation of the phylogenetic results, but some additional information would help support the authors' conclusions regarding the genome maps and proposed model of transcription.1. The text refers to the \"difficulty\" of sequencing linear genomes, and repeatedly states that \"nearly complete\" or \"more-or-less complete\" genomes were obtained. What does this mean?  How complete or incomplete were the genomes? (And what is the distinction between \"near-complete\" and \"more-or-less complete\"? - lines 163-164 imply one has been made.)  Were particular regions of genomes (i.e. the ends of linear chromosomes) typically missing?  Or is the incompleteness due to areas of low-quality reads within particular regions of particular genomes?  If the latter, were biases seen (certain regions of poor quality in all genomes) or were low-coverage areas distributed randomly among taxa?   How much missing data was there within the alignments used for phylogenetic inference?  2. Models of mt gene transcription suggest that in other metazoans transcription is bounded (\"punctuated\") by tRNAs.  Hydrozoan mt genomes code for only two tRNAs, so the authors suggest that the recovery of a total of 6 poly- and monocistronic transcripts from the RADseq data implies that there must be additional punctuation sites that are specified by motifs other than tRNAs. The hypotheses proposed are consistent with the data presented here, but are they consistent with results obtained from RADseq data of other metazoans?  In taxa that have a full complement of tRNAs in their mt genomes, does RADseq only recover transcripts (mono- or polycistronic) that are bounded by tRNAs?  Or are polycistronic precursors also found? What about other taxa (Anthozoans, sponges) that lack most tRNAs?  Seems like there should be enough RADseq data out there to support the model further by confirming (1) that taxa with lots of tRNAs produce many, short transcripts, and (2) other non-Hydroidolinan taxa with few tRNAs produce more transcripts than expected if punctuation were only to occur at tRNAs.             Comments:Mostly minor comments that don't really fit into the previous categories:97: \"barcoding approach\" is not really the appropriate term for single-locus systematics studies; barcoding typically seeks to delimit species rather than to understand their phylogenetic relationships102: See also Foox et al 2015 Mitochondrial DNA137: Table S1 doesn't seem to include \"maps of long PCR amplifications\" as stated in the text225: What is SRR871528?

For example, was 13.1% the lowest GC content observed for a gene (compared to all genes in all taxa), or the lowest GC content observed within a taxon (averaged across all genes)?  244-246: How does this conclusion that there is no compositional bias among taxa square with the very wide range of GC values reported in Table 2, and with the statement (230) that GC content was variable between and within classes?285: I would have thought tRNAs would be excised rather than incised...293: aplanatulan?

Results show that Siphonophorae is the first diverging clade, sister to a clade comprising Leptothecata + Filifera (III + IV) and Aplanulata + Capitata + Filifera (I + II). The authors investigate mitochondrial gene order and propose a mechanism for mt mRNA expression based on gene order and RNA-seq data.

No Comments                 No Comments             Comments:The phylogeny based on mitochondrial sequences, even with the complete mt genome, is only part of the story. Despite this being the largest dataset for Hydroidolina, the nuclear genome remains largely unsampled. With 'the ever-decreasing price of sequencing', the authors should comment on whether the nuclear genome could clarify/correct the inferences much more. We know that for some other cnidarians, mitochondrial sequences can be problematic (Kitahara et al. 2014, PLoS ONE). There are some rather long branches (e.g. Filifera I, II) that hint at the possibility of similar issues.Lines 73&#8211;74: The distinction between citations and taxon authorities is unclear. Aplanulata, for instance, should be Aplanulata Collins, Winkelman, Hadrys &amp; Schierwater, 2005. Perhaps state the authority for each taxon, and move and consolidate the citations at the end of the sentence.The authors mention that their multiplexing strategy is new, but it is not clear which part of their protocol is novel. Labelled ('barcode') primers have been used for some time, and the introduction of double indexing by Illumina means that the combination consequently results in quadruple tagging.

As this this work is outside my area, I can only accept this at face value. The methods are clearly described, along with selection criteria, procedure and analytical choices.  There are several hypotheses, clearly made. Where sometimes it seemed that the background literature could support or contradict some of these predictions, the authors are clear on the lack of a directional prediction (e.g., bilateral vs radial symmetry). I have one concern about the design that may be worth considering. Because participants saw both colour and sepia images, it is possible that this contrast lead people to rate the colour flowers more positively overall. In other words, sepia judgements were lowered because of participant&#8217;s exposure to and judgement of colour images. It&#8217;s an empirical question, but I suspect if people judged only sepia images you would see an increase in the variance of ratings of the sepia images, relative to the current study.

Is it because the microbial species pool will be changing, host phenotype/genotype will be changing, environmental constraints imposed on potential microbial colonists, some combination of explanations? Can you provide some recent work that demonstrates any of these mechanisms? A number of recent publications show how exposure to drought modifies the root microbiome, likely indirectly through changes in host phenotypes (Naylor et al. 2017 ISME, Santos-Medillin 2017 mBIO, Fitzpatrick et al. 2018 PNAS).

Throughout the manuscript the fungal portion of the project feels a bit under-explained/justified, an add-on. Sample preparation and DNA extraction (L130-151). Readers will need more detail either in the main text or the supplement to effectively understand these methods. L133: &#8216;aboveground surface of the plant&#8217; &#8211; does this include stem, floral, petiole etc? Phyllosphere typically means foliar tissue, excluding the rest of the aboveground tissues. L135-141: I don&#8217;t understand how rhizosphere and phylosphere compartments were separated here. Did you remove all leaves from an individual and vortex these to get the phyllosphere? And then remove all roots and vortex to get the rhizosphere? Did you standardize by # of leaves or roots, or biomass of leaves or roots? Given that there may have been differences in growth between seedlings growing at edge versus within sites was this taken into account at the sampling stage or analytical stage, using biomass as a covariate?L142-151: I don&#8217;t understand the sequence of events in this protocol. I think the authors took samples after epiphyte collection and performed an EtOH wash with water rinses, then finely section them before putting them into DNA extraction tubes. This isn&#8217;t clear as written though. Do you have a citation for this particular method of surface sterilizing? Same comment as above, did you standardize the plant biomass going into each extraction across tissues, sites? Also why a 45 min. bead beating stage? Did the authors use a vortex for this step or a tissue homogenizer? 45 mins. in a high powered homogenizer would likely shear all DNA.Biomarker analysis (L227-237): Given that the LEfSe results are so central to your study I would like to see more description of the modeling process here or in the supplement. A brief description of LDA would be helpful for unfamiliar readers and a lucid description of what &#8216;effect size&#8217;, how it is calculated and statistically tested is needed. With 100s-1000s of microbial taxa tested in analyses like these multiple testing can be problematic. Can the authors comment on how this was controlled for?L 350: Is there any ecological significance of Mortierella. Given its high abundance maybe it has been documented previously as an important endophyte, mutualist or pathogen?                 I&#8217;m not familiar with forest ecology in Quebec but stating that 100 m is an elevational gradient is a stretch in any system. The authors state that sugar maple&#8217;s elevational range is from 600 &#8211; 1000 m, why was more an effort not made to capture the extent of this range? Even 400m seems unlikely to result in any large environmental variation but at least it is biologically relevant for the host. Additionally, given the lack of replication of within and edge populations it&#8217;s near impossible to attribute any of the differences observed here to elevation, they could be due to confounding spatial variation. This is a major limitation that needs to be addressed much more openly throughout the manuscript.  Why were soil or other environmental samples accompanying each site not collected? This would have been very informative regarding whether host-associated shifts were caused by a shift in the microbial species pool occurring across sites. Given that all of the sampling occurred on plant seedlings is there any reason to suspect that results may differ across developmental stages of the plant?Would it be useful to have an additional biomarker analysis which compares epi- and endophytes separately for roots and leaves? The biomarker analysis using the comparison of endophytes to epiphytes pooled across above and belowground tissues may be missing a number of taxa that differentiate epi and endo habitats in each particular tissue. One analysis that I would like to see is whether or not measures of diversity and composition covary among epiphytic and endophytic compartments across and within root and leaf compartments, and possibly across elevation. Simple correlation for measures of diversity and a Mantel test for measures of composition could do this. Figure 4 seems to indicate that the variance in community composition seems to decrease at edge sites in root microbiota. Testing for unequal variance might be informative.                 L326: According to figure 5, only root endophytic compartments exhibited altered diversity across range. Though Table 5 and figure 5 conflict with respect to sig. of rhizosphere compartments. L 354: I don&#8217;t agree with the biological interpretation of these results. To say that Proteobacteria are more associated with leaves than roots just doesn&#8217;t make sense. There are members of the Proteobacteria that are very strongly and exclusively associated with roots and at high abundance (e.g. Rhizobiales). Speaking in terms of relative abundance may be more appropriate here and in other instances regarding the LEfSe results.L357: I&#8217;m not following the logic here. How do greater taxonomic associations found in roots lead to greater effect of the environment on belowground host microbiota?The authors state in L 360 &#8211; 363 (and elsewhere: L381, 385-387,  that their results confirm a shift in microbial community structure in leaves and roots across the natural range of sugar maple to its edge. This is much too strongly worded given the inability to actually detect elevation-specific differences in the dataset (see comment in Experimental Design above). Qualifying that the elevational and not geographic range is being considered here is also important as this statement suggests a much larger sampling design than exists (also at L427). Finally, though I appreciate the speculation, that these shifts may be linked to host plant fitness and function is just unfounded. I think if this section were expanded with relevant citations, which demonstrate how shifts in associated microbial communities may be linked to host function, than this would be ok. In the discussion I was hoping to see more links back to the concepts from the introduction. If we assume that the differences observed here really reflect altered host microbiota across an elevational range, what does this tell us? That the microbial species pool from which host microbiota are assembled has changed? That host phenotype or genotype has changed, thus precipitating a shift in the associated microbiota? Are these changes in host genotype or phenotype being driven by environmental differences across the elevational range, in turn shaping microbial communities (e.g. GXE shown in Edwards et al. 2015 PNAS, Wagner et al. 2016 Nat Comm)? How might changes in associated microbial communities be altering host plant survival or growth across an elevation change?L404-405: This is misleading. According to figure 5 only root endophytic compartments exhibited statistically different diversity across range. Fig. 2: What do the light shaded green and red fans mean? Something to do with monophly of association? Why do some clades (e.g. Actinobacteria in panel a) have a fan of one color but individual nodes with a different color?Fig. 5: no legend for boxplot colors.             Comments:Wallace et al. investigate variation in the diversity and composition foliar and root microbiota of Acer saccharum across an elevational gradient. First, the authors should be commended for taking the study of host-associated microbiota out of the lab and into the field. Characterization of host microbiota in natural populations and across environmental gradients is needed for a complete understanding of their ecological importance.L23-24: Here it sounds like the authors characterized bacterial and fungal communities for each compartment but from reading Table S2, fungal communities were only characterized from the root endophytic compartment? Please clarify. L52-53: Completely optional, but I&#8217;m wondering if the distinction between epi- and endophytic communities should come in now? Here the authors say on the leaves but the study focuses on both in/on leaves and roots. L62: I completely agree that this is an important question in host microbiome research but I would like to see a bit more explanation here. From an evolutionary perspective, measuring the genetic covariance across traits is important because it can tell us whether pleiotropy and adaptive constraints may exist. I think the same reasoning goes for microbial community structure if you imagine communities across different tissues as &#8216;traits&#8217;, are they controlled through independent mechanisms?L66: What about sugar maple is ecologically important? Just biomass or something more?L96: I don&#8217;t quite understand how this statement is connected to the current research. Are you suggesting that genetic/phenotypic differences in sugar maple at the expansion front may cause differences in associated microbiota?L119: Are these trees from an experimental plot or have they recruited to these sites naturally?Fig S1: The informational content of Figure S1 could be improved. Maybe a Google earth map adjacent to the existing figure that shows the spatial structure of the collection sites? I would like to see information about the spatial separation between sites included in the Specimen Collection section. L152: Were negative controls used during PCR? Any indication of contamination during the extraction or amplification stage?L172: Two-step PCR for 16S sequencing seems like it might introduce (even more) bias into the final amplicon pool. Can the authors comment on this?L202: Just curious why 20 cycles were used for 16S amplification but 35 cycles for ITS amplification? Is this simply due to there being lower fungal DNA yields after extraction?L265: How were taxa defined as core here? For example, core rhizosphere taxa = found in every rhizosphere, whereas core plant taxa = found in every compartment of every plant?L331: is the word &#8216;by&#8217; a typo here?L360: I don&#8217;t understand the &#8216;associations with planting&#8217; here. L374-377: This model of microbiome assembly has been proposed. Who knows when it was originally proposed but I usually attribute it to Bulgarelli et al. 2013 AREES.L421: Here and throughout I think the authors can do a better job drawing from recent advances in host (and particularly plant) microbiome research. We now know that plant immune phenotypes can alter associated microbial communities, that resource availability can trigger immune responses, in turn shaping associated microbial communities (Lebeis et al. 2015 Science, Castrillo et al. 2017 Nature, Hacquard et al. 2017 CHOM). The root microbiome can dynamically respond to abiotic stress, potentially mediating negative effects (Naylor et al. 2017 ISME, Santos-Medillin 2017 mBIO, Fitzpatrick et al. 2018 PNAS).

Additionally, for the Biomarker analysis/ISA (L234), it is not clear why only the phyla level was examined. Illumina sequencing produces only amplicon abundances or short genomic regions, it would be worth adding a qualification for the value of this analysis given that finer taxonomic resolution is not being presented and the discussion of variability of groups across elevational ranges and plant compartments does not reflect specific species counts but sequencing reads.

Comments:Introduction-\tL66-101, The two paragraphs beginning at L66 (through to L101), the information regarding the specific biology of Acer saccharum and the more general ecological properties of shifting range limits under climate change with abiotic and biotic interactions are too mixed together.

", "This is a well-written manuscript describing a study on plant-associated bacterial and fungal communities associated with Acer saccharum (sugar maple) within and at the edge of its elevational range in Quebec. The authors use a high-throughput culture-free MiSeq-based approach to quantify microbial community composition and diversity. They compare the bacterial communities between leaf surface and interiors, root surfaces and interiors, and the fungal communities from within roots, between two sites within and two sites at the upper edge of the elevational range. They find differences between the plant compartments and between plants sampled within and at the edge of the elevational range.The literature is, for the most part, appropriately used to provide context and is cited appropriately. I was surprised not to see mention of the Fierer et al. study from 2011 (published in Ecology) on elevational ranges of phyllosphere microbial communities, since it seems quite relevant. I've included the citation below. The figures and tables are professionally done, except for a few omissions related to the captions or legends (detailed below).The raw sequence data are available, however they may be incomplete. The barcode sequences are not provided for 16S or ITS, nor the metadata necessary to demultiplex the raw fastq files, so the raw sequencing data are currently unusable. A quick grep search of the fastq files suggests that they contain just the sequences themselves, and lack the 16S or ITS primers and the barcodes that would be necessary for de-multiplexing them. This information does not seem to be encoded in the fastq sequence names, either, as far as I can tell. Additionally, there is no mention in the text of where the raw data will be deposited (even a placeholder), so it is not clear that they will be placed into an appropriate publicly available sequence repository (e.g. NCBI SRA) upon publication.There were a number of minor technical errors in the methods that I point out below.                 In my opinion, the research questions inherent in this study (the extent to which microbial communities vary within plants and within and at thresholds of a plant's elevational range) are important ones where additional work is welcome. I agree with the authors that only a few (although the number is growing) plant microbiome studies simultaneously assess the communities in multiple plant compartments. I also think that the question of whether the microbial communities associated with plant hosts change at the edge of the host's elevational range is an interesting one and is worth pursuing.I would have liked to see some information about the geographic proximity of the two within and two edge sites. My understanding of how the statistical analyses were presented in the paper is that all of the samples were treated independently. However, because there were two sites in each of the major classes (within and at the edge) there may be pseudoreplication within a given site that is structuring the data and needs to be addressed. The other study design concern I had was in relation to the age of the saplings. From looking at the metadata table provided as a supplement, it looks like all of the saplings sampled from the range edge sites are two years old, while the ones from within the range varied from 2-7 years. How can you be sure that the effects you observed are due to the differences in sapling location (within vs edge) and not just due to differences in plant age? It seems like an additional test on the within range data specifically focusing on sapling age could be used to test for an effect. If there is none, then this should be stated in the results.The authors incorrectly state that they used the ITS1 primer for their fungal sequencing. The primer they list out fully in the text is ITS1F, the fungal-specific version of ITS1 that was first presented in Gardes and Bruns 1993. These are different primers; the F isn't just for 'forward'.I liked that the field sampling permit was included.                 While I have confidence for the most part in the wet lab components of this project (aside from no mention of a negative extraction or PCR controls, and no citation for the effectiveness of the surface sterilization method used -- most studies I've read use a dilute bleach solution in addition to ethanol to remove surface microbes and degrade their DNA), I have several fairly major concerns with the statistical analyses that will definitely need to be adressed before acceptance. The most important one is that I am not convinced that the permutational p values that were presented in association with the PERMANOVA tests are meaningful. In many of the cases where the authors are making comparisons between plant compartments or sites, they would need to block their permutations to only permute within a given plot, compartment, or elevation. Otherwise, treating all samples as independent ignores the structure in the sampling design and could serve to inappropriately lower the p-values derived from the calculations. The authors mention on line 293 that communities within a given elevation (within vs edge) did not show significant between-plot differences, but it is unclear which samples they are talking about here (which compartment, bacteria vs fungi, etc). To analyze differences in compartments, the permutations should be blocked by elevation, otherwise you risk confounding elevation and compartment effects. To analyze differences in elevation, permutation of samples should be blocked by compartment.These nested permutation designs can be specified with the permute package in R, and then these restricted permutations can be applied to tests such as the PERMANOVA (via the adonis or adonis2 functions in the vegan package). However, these restricted permutations require a balanced experimental design, so in order to use this approach, the authors would need to subsample their data to the least number of samples in a given category, and this will lower their statistical power. It may be that after recalculating the proper p values, the results all remain valid, but I think it is important to correct this before the manuscript is accepted for publication. They should also test for multivariate homoskedasticity, as big differences in multivariate dispersion (such as those shown in the NMDS ordination plots) can influence the conclusions from a PERMANOVA analysis. The authors should also check and verify that the assumptions of the parametric ANOVA (independence, homoskedasticity, normality of the residuals) are met for their Shannon diversity comparisons, or else switch to a test that is robust to non-parametric data.While I appreciate the authors including the R script they used for their analysis, it seems to be incomplete -- there is no portion of the code that runs the PERMANOVA tests and so it is impossible to assess if these were done correctly or not. On a similar note, I think it would be appropriate to include the commands and parameters used for the PEAR and QIIME processing of the data. These bioinformatic pipelines have many parameters, each of which can exert a large influence on the final outcome and conclusions of a study and are not otherwise mentioned in the methods as described.I appreciate the inclusion of the OTU, taxonomy, and metadata tables as supplementary info, but I think the metadata tables in particular could be improved with the addition of the units used in each of the numeric columns and some sort of key (perhaps in a README) to interpret the codes used in the categorical ones.             Comments:The wording in the Methods section of the abstract is imprecise. You did not quantify 'bacterial and fungal community structure in four plant compartments' -- you only did this for the bacteria. I'd suggest revising to make this more clear. This is also true in the Results -- you don't show that the communties  differ in all four compartments for both bacteria and fungi, only bacterial data are presented in all four plant compartments. You don't have the data to show that 'the fungal genus Mortierella was also very abundant in all compartments'. Upon reading these I thought that perhaps I was misunderstanding the study design, but table S2 clearly suggests that the only compartment you sampled for fungi was the root interior.I am not clear why only the fungi from the root interior were sequenced. I think the rationale should be included -- this is particularly confusing because in several places in the abstract, there is mention of fungi being sampled in all plant compartments. I think the bacterial aspects of the work could stand on their own, but I also think it's valuable to have the additional fungal data out in the world. So I would suggest leaving them in and just being a little more comprehensive when explaining the rationale for just focusing on fungi in the one compartment.Specific comments:line 183: ITS is not a gene.lines 210-211: The sequences were removed if the window score dropped below five? Perhaps you mean they were trimmed?line 220: Why this number of sequences?line 223: Perhaps this is a typo? It would make sense if it were 280,000line 239: This is a reasonable cutoff, but then your species accumulation curves are much less informative if they are drawn without these rare OTUs.line 322: In this paragraph and elsewhere, I think it would be helpful to include the degrees of freedom used for the ANOVA F-test. Since there are so many comparisons being made between and within categories, having the degrees of freedom listed would help to clarify the number of groups and the number of samples being compared.line 335: Did or did not? Most people generally consider alpha = 0.05 to be a reasonable cutoff, not alpha = 0.1.line 362: How can you be sure that the effect you observe is due to the range edge and not just simply an increase in elevation (or some other abiotic or biotic factor)?line 363: But might there also be associational gains? In many cases the diversity is not significantly different even if the community composition is.line 386: I think this is a bit too strong of a statement. You don't show any evidence that indicates that the microbial communities could be having a causal effect on range edge dynamics.Figure 3: I would suggest including the legend on this figure -- it would make it easier to interpret at a glance.Figure 5: It isn't stated in the caption or on the figure which of each pair is within vs edge. Table 3: I think these p-values should be recalculated with proper restricted permutations. That won't affect the R^2 value, so I imagine the primary trends will be robust, but I do not think that the p values are likely to be accurate.Table 5: Are these the mean of overall values? vs the means of each of the two elevational classes (within vs edge)? What are the degrees of freedom being used here?Figure S1: I think a map of the study area would be useful in addition to this diagram. That would help the reader evaluate the proximity of the sites to one another.Table S1: I think this table could be augmented with some of the data in the 'metadata' table provided on figshare. I'd also be curious about the other factors that could be driving your results -- temperature, surrounding species, substrate changes, etc.Sources cited:Fierer, N., C. M. McCain, P. Meir, M.

Why did you use three leaves for functional measurements and five for endophyte characterizations?   Were the same leaves used for both functional and endophyte analysis?  Were the leaf samples evaluated independently?  If multiple samples were taken from branches and within trees and evaluated independently, this study is pseudoreplicated and the samples from each branch and tree should have been combined (I see that you did this properly for stomatal measurements).  But I feel that this is not the case for endophyte analysis, because the authors state that 45 samples were taken from only 5 individuals. This is important to specify.  Moreover, if all five individuals occur within a 15-m radius, your conclusions might be limited and potentially confounded, because conspecifics in closely spaced habitats can share microbes, even endophytes that disperse on the leaf surface and ultimately gain access to leaf interiors (Griffin &amp; Carson 2015).

Comments:This study aims to determine the relative importance of temporal variation and plant functional traits in structuring bacterial endophyte communities of Quercus petraea.  The plant microbiome and the factors that structure these communities are timely important areas of research, particularly among forest trees.

I suspect that there were some difficulties in a language barrier.  For a future submission, I would recommend that the authors send the manuscript to a colleague whose first language is English for detailed comments.  I comment on (some) instances below.Moreover, there were quite a few instances where important papers/citations were not used, or where more relevant and recent citations should be used.

", "Overall comments: This paper suggests that temporal variation in bacterial assemblages is present within the leaves of sessile oak. The most interesting finding was that leaf herbivory was an important predictor of community divergence. I commend the authors on pursuing timely questions and presenting some interesting findings. The main suggestions I have to improve the paper are: 1. The statistics employed do not appear to account for non-independence among samples imposed by temporal or spatial autocorrelation. 2. The introduction is very brief and does not give the reader much information regarding what to expect or why the study was performed. Providing more information here would make the paper read much better. More detailed suggestions follow.Title: The phrase &#8220;community structures&#8221; is somewhat vague. Perhaps using slightly different phrasing would be better.IntroductionLines: 36-37. This introductory sentence seems quite broad and somewhat inappropriate. Perhaps you could start by saying how not much is known about temporal variation in microbial assemblages (as you suggest in line 38). The appeal for interdisciplinary work seems unnecessary.Second paragraph: no mention is made of the potentially harmful effects of endophytic bacteria. It may be worth providing a citation for the reader that shows how some bacteria likely interact antagonistically with their hosts. Line 61: This sentence is unclear as written.Line 69: This sentence seems to contradict itself, perhaps it would be best to rewrite.Line 70 onwards: It may be worth setting up some expectations here for why certain plant traits may influence endophyte assemblages. For instance, perhaps SLA is important because it represents within-leaf habitat. Also, additional citations here would help many readers. Why do we think leaf age may be associated with shifts in endophyte assemblages?Additionally, there is no information about why we should expect endophyte communities to vary with time, or the many studies that have shown temporal variation does exist for both endophytic bacteria and fungi. There probably should be a whole paragraph describing why temporal variation matters and setting up expectations. Overall the introduction has some good background information but could be improved by better setting up expectations and justifications for your study.MethodsLine 86: admixed does not seem like the best word here. Line 137: Was a repeated measures approach taken when calculating the ANOVA to account for temporal autocorrelation? If not, then this should be performed. Additionally, the statistics need to account for the highly nested nature of your data. You sampled multiple leaves from the same branch, and multiple branches from the same tree. These leaves are therefore not independent measurements and you will want to account for that statistically. A mixed effect model is an easy way to do this. Mixed effects models can be specified quickly in the R environment (see the lme4 package).  Line 140: the Bonferroni measure is very conservative. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction may be a better choice. It is possible that the greater sensitivity of the latter test might expand your inferences slightly. It would be helpful to provide readers more information about the ARISA technique in the methods or introduction as I suspect many people will be unfamiliar with this method. Also the acronym is never defined. ResultsLine 156: I have used the phrase &#8220;community structure&#8221; in my own work, but have grown dissatisfied with the phrase because it is so vague. Could you perhaps say that &#8220;community composition&#8221; shifted? Line 168: It is very interesting that herbivory was the most important predictor variable. I would like to see a bit more about this in the discussion if possible.Discussion: Line 173: The phrase &#8220;structure variations&#8221; was unclear to me. Perhaps reword.Line 175: What do you mean by &#8220;robustness&#8221; here. Do you mean ARISA is a good way to detect large differences in community composition (as suggested by the citation)?Line 177: Please reword slightly. I understood this sentence to mean that the bacterial assemblage differed in leaves removed from the trees in spring and autumn. Is that correct?                 The questions addressed by the paper are timely and important. Not much is known regarding how plant traits affect microbes, or how microbial communities shift over time. The use of ARISA precludes taxon-specific analyses, but still provides some interesting insights.                 The experimental design was highly nested with multiple samples taken from the same branch, and multiple branches from the same tree. There was no mention of how this was accounted for statistically, or how temporal autocorrelation was addressed. The statistical methods should be improved. I would also like to see a bit more in the discussion regarding why herbivory may be linked to shifts in community composition. This was a very interesting result, but was not discussed in detail.

"], "10.7717/peerj.2805": ["This article is generally very well written with sufficient introduction and background that is used to demonstrate how this work fits into the wider research area. This work is also self-contained and detailed. There is one major problem, however, when one considers the availability of the raw data. I was unable to find any tables of spin densities / population. I find this extremely surprising since they are refereed to in the text and are of the UP MOST important when investigating this spin-forbidden reaction mechanism. It leaves many questions unanswered, about for instance whether the 1I1 intermediate is a closed or open shell species. Also please replace all the instances of the generic \"ring-cleaving 2,4-dioxygenase\" with \"1-H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine-2,4-dioxygenase (HOD)\". Finally, please change (line 139) \"As in the work we criticize\" to \"As in previous work by Hernandez-Ortega et al.\"                 This work does include some important and new finding, however, when using a different software package and especially a modified basis set it is important to run full optimisation for all local minima and transition state structures. The problem with this approach is clearly demonstrated in Table 1 1I1, where the the large wt (R=CH3) system is only 0.6 kcal/mol higher in energy than 3R. This compares to an energy of approximately 10 kcal/mol reported by Aitor-Hernandez et al. Since the apparent driving force for this step is so much lower one may expect that 3TS1 is lower to. Therefore, the characterisation of this transition state is crucial to any further analysis.                 In lines 142-144 the authors say that a C-O bond length of between 1.4 and 1.5 A is extremely short for a substrate superoxo. This is incorrect an indeed the xyz files (provided) show that the 1I1 structures have C-O bond lengths below this value. It is not at all surprising that there are longer bond lengths in the MECP structures, since this crossing point would presumably happen somewhere along the oxygen transfer step, however, this doesn't make the prier statement true. The MECP structures are very interesting, however, I am unsure about the conclusion the authors draw from these results. Firstly, the MECP energies are extremely close to the 3TS1 energies calculated by the previous JACs paper (within 2 kcal/mol). This is within the margin or error for this theory, also again I can not stress enough how problematic it is not to have 3TS1 calculated with the same very small cluster and basis set. The question of the direct electron transfer is more interesting still the values that are reported here (for the oxygen reduction) are again very close to the values reported before by the prier mentioned article. However, the main issue in the JACs paper was that the authors were unable to find a stable 2SUB* 2O2*- species. It is unclear that such a species has been found here. In line 221 the author indicate that CO release in the prier mentioned paper was changed by up to 20 kcal/mol depending on the substrate's R-group. This is indeed inaccurate. The affect of these substituents was assessed to be between 2.3 -5.1 kcal/mol. The misunderstanding here seems to be the switch in rate-limiting step with the various substrates. Finally, there is too little information on reactivity of urate oxidase (just 1 page) this needs to be either substantially expanded or else removed.             Comments:I would respectfully request that you read the above comments carefully. I my view the single most crucial thing that needs to be done is to find 3TS1 from 3R using the same model and basis set that was used for the MECP.                                                ", "The manuscript is generally well written but tends to be scientifically inaccurate.Several modifications should be done:The title should be rewritten: oxygen and 1-H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine are the dioxygenase substrates. Without enzyme there is not reaction between oxygen and the 1-H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine.- Abstract: &#8220;bacterial ring cleaving 2,4 dioxygenase&#8221; is not a valid name for an enzyme. Instead is recommended to use its full name (1-H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine-2,4-dioxygenase) rather than other names. This applies for lines: 36, 106, 114, 276 and 291.- Line 37: &#8220;flavin-like reactivity&#8221; is scientifically inaccurate. Radical pair mechanism is the correct term here. In general, the comparison that is made with respect to flavin reactivity is not correct from a chemically or an enzymatically point of view. Expressions as &#8220;flavin-like fashion&#8221; of &#8220;flavin-like reactivity&#8221; should be removed. The author should know that each flavoprotein is exhibiting different reactivity against oxygen, and therefore, different mechanism. - Lines 40-43: Same citation appears twice. One should be removed. The paragraph is confusing, consider revision.Some background literature needs to be updated or changed:- Lines 19-21: The introduction should be mainly focus on the oxygen reactivity and its activation during enzymatic reactions. Some references here about proteins binding or generating oxygen, and the role of their transition metals, is either not clear or irrelevant. - The article from Massey 1994, is not only quite old is additionally a chemistry paper. To show that radical pairs are formed in flavin-oxygenases, some examples of these enzymes in which the radical pair has been detected or computationally calculated, should be cited here; specially considering that the author states that the mechanism employed by flavin oxygenases (or even oxygenases) is similar to the one followed by cofactor free oxygenases.- Lines 51-60: It seems that here has been clearly a misunderstanding from the data reported by Hernandez-Ortega et al. First, the 8-11 kcal/mol were calculated from the equation 5 in which only the electron transfer is considered and all the reaction species were optimized (and their energies calculated) separately. Second, please read the original article (page 7479, right column) in which is clearly reported that those two potential energy surfaces were calculated.                 The description of the computational methodology needs to be clearer and separated in different subsections (one for each research question that is addressed). For example, it seems that two different systems are used but it is not clear which methodology is applied for each. Apparently, most optimized structures were taken from the Supplementary Information from Hernandez-Ortega et al. article. If a different basis set or different software package is used, is crucial to run a full optimization (or reaction scan) for each local minima or transition state structures calculated. In other words, it is impossible to know whether the MECP or 3TS1 (from Hernandez-Ortega et al.) are higher in energy.                 The most interesting aspect for discussion is about if the electron transfer happens prior to the oxygen attack to create a superoxide/substrate radical pair or not. However, it seems that the author have not got a fully optimised superoxide and substrate radical structure which is crucial to validate his findings. This is the main reason why this can not be assessed (as stated for example in lines 186-189). This optimised structure (with a radical on both the oxygen and the substrate) should be provided. Whether the spin crossing happens during the oxygen binding (as reported in the present work) or just after (as reported before) makes little difference to the general enzyme mechanism.Line 172-175: It is true that a direct electron transfer was postulated for flavins by Massey, 1994, but the direct electron transfer taking place in glucose oxidase (Prabhakar, 2002) is a spontaneous exothermic process. By contrast, in the present work most of the obtained values for the electron transfer are endothermic. In this sense, this citation is not supporting the author findings. Table 3: It is not clear what this data is it adding to the discussion about the reactivity of the enzyme or its mechanism.The section about &#8220;other oxygenases&#8221; is brief and incomplete.

They found, for example, evidence for a force-endurance tradeoff in females, but not in males.  Their conclusion is a list several comparisons among many parameters, making it difficult for the reader to extract a central finding.  However, an interesting claim is made that selective pressures are sex-specific, but it is not well supported or explained.  Additionally, I have general technical concerns with data collection and analysis that must be addressed before the ms is suitable for publication.General comments:1. My main concern is that although many of the relationships reported are statistically significant, the r^2 values are all very low, indicating unexplained variability.  The authors have not addressed this unexplained variability.  The authors have used partial regression statistics in part of the analysis -  however, I suggest a more thorough partial regression analysis to account for additional variability.  For example, although it&#8217;s intriguing that ilium length correlates to force in males, it only explains less than 29% of the variation in peak force.  Perhaps there is something meaningful here, but the authors do not report evidence to rule out other possibilities.  For example, maybe ilium length correlates to some other morphological feature (neglected from the analysis) that more directly contributes to force? 2. Another large concern is that the authors did not mention whether they elicited maximum performance for each frog.  If each individual is hopping at some fraction of its maximum capacity, there is a large random parameter in the data set which may contribute to the large variability observed.  If this is the case, how can individuals be compared to one another?  Thus, I do not see how the authors can make their claim if the locomotor motivation varies among individuals.3. From the figure, medio-lateral forces seem significant, however they are absent from the analysis.  These forces should be explained &#8211; are the frogs producing these high lateral forces because they are forced to jump on a circular track (i.e. always turning)?  Or is this a random variable that is influencing the resultant force, but not horizontal/vertical components (thus biasing the results)?  4. Throughout the ms, there is a focus on peak ground reaction forces compared to limb length.  However, shouldn&#8217;t limb length correlate more strongly to the duration of force on the ground?  If so, I feel the authors should measure impulse instead of (or in addition to) peak forces, especially since peak forces for the smallest frogs are prone to greater error (lower signal/noise) in the force recordings.   Using impulse measurements might reduce the unexplained variability in the data set.5. One central claim seems to be that selection acts differentially on males vs. females.  But, this claim is presented as an afterthought at the end of the discussion and the arguments preceding are not compelling.  The authors should better explain why their data lead to this conclusion.  Additionally, one piece of evidence for differential selection comes from Fig. 3 showing that males produce greater force at a given size.  However, the different body size distributions between sexes is not mentioned in the paper.  It seems that selection is acting on body size itself such that absolute forces are nearly equal between sexes.  In other words, males may be smaller, on average compared to females (from inspecting fig. 3 by eye). Regardless, the authors should report information on the size distribution of males vs. females to see if this influences the data are interpreted.Specific comments:1. L88-89: Females invest more of what, specifically (calories, etc.)? 2. Methods: How was jump distance measured? Were individual jump distances measured? Was this done with high speed video?3. L166-174: Resultant and vertical forces are compared throughout, but horizontal forces are only mentioned in the first comparison and medio-lateral forces are neglected entirely which seems strange given that they are similar in magnitude as horizontal (e.g. Fig. 1).4. L192-205: I&#8217;m confused why r values are reported in this section whereas r^2 values are reported in the previous section.5. L166-205: Many comparisons are made here, making it difficult to keep track.  The authors should consider repeating these correlation data in a table to make the results easier to digest and compare.6.  Fig. 1: It seems confusing and odd to include the entire time trace, including the time before the animal is on the plate.  I.e. it&#8217;s unnecessary and confusing to show the force response to the animal being placed on the plate (before 7.5 s). I suggest truncate the plot so it begins at ~7.5 s and ends ~8 s so that the details of the actual jump are expanded.   Also, why isn&#8217;t the left-right force mentioned in the legend?7.

Are they individual jumps or a single maximum value for all jumps of any given individual?

E.g. variation in muscle histochemistry could theoretically cause a trade-off between the performance of a single jump and the distance jumped to exhaustion. It would be useful to have the regression equations stated in the figure legends.                 No comments                 Did the authors test for repeatability in jumping and swimming performance? It would be useful to know how repeatable these measures were in this study or for the previously determined repeatability of these measures in other studies to be cited.In the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis the first model produced will reflect the anatomical variable that best predicts the variation in the performance variable. However, there may be other anatomical variables that are also highly correlated, maybe almost as highly correlated, with that performance variable. I think that the way your data is presented hides some of this information. There may be correlation between the anatomical variables as well and, dependent on the degree of such correlation (assessment of variable inflation factor), other authors might have opted to use principal component analysis prior to regression analysis. I suggest that the correlations between anatomical variables and performance data is presented, as well as presentation of the multiple regression data, and/or the complete data set is made available and/or analysis of VIF values is undertaken to determine whether colinearity of anatomical variables is an issue.             Comments:This is an interesting manuscript demonstrating that: males produced higher jump forces, than females, relative to body mass or leg length; In each sex different anatomical variables predicted variation in jump force; Peak jump forces and distance to exhaustion were all correlated with eachother, whereas peak horizontal force was correlated to maximal swimming performance, but that these relationships differed between sexes.There are a few typos in the manuscript e.g. Line 218 replace &#8220;while&#8221; with &#8220;why&#8221;.

The background evidence presented is of decent quality but it is not well interpreted, as I don not understand what \"peripheral traits\" in psychopathy are and they are not explained. Also, the author does not explain what the connection between resilience and psychopathy is. Is it that psychopaths are more or less resilient? The author speaks of \"successful psychopaths\" and \"unsuccessful psychopaths\" being different but does not explain what that means or how it is really relevant in this study. I reviewed the article that they cite on The Tower of Hanoi and psychopathic tendencies (DOI: 10.1080/09084282.2010.52338). The article looks at Psychopathic traits and compares the performance on the computerized version vs. the manual version. They conclude that low/moderate psychopathy scorers performed poorly on the computerized Tower of Hanoi while high psychopathy scorers performed better on the computerized version in comparison. The conclusion was that high scores on computerized Tower of Hanoi tests should be interpreted with some caution as a result, and was not really related to the psychopathy traits the way the authors of this paper seem to imply.                 The data surrounding NE and MR and psychopathy is nebulous at best. It was difficult to understand what the hypothesis they were testing was. Beta Blockers do not \"block\" NE- they decrease response to it by competing for the receptors. This is an important distinction because some beta blockers have partial agonist activity which modulates response to NE/E and also changes the cellular response to the hormones. As for MR receptors, it's true they're expressed in the amygdala, but what about the cortex and the prefrontal cortex? If they're commenting on executive functioning and correlating it psychopathy using the Tower of Hanoi test, then it would make sense to discuss the role of the prefrontal cortex/cortex in executive functioning and planning. The SNPs that were chosen: why those in particular? One of them is the transporter for NE and one of them is just part of the MR gene. I don't really understand why those are relevant. As for the use of the PPI-SF, for the most part that methodology was sound, as this scale was normed on college students. I do not particularly understand why they chose to use firefighters, however. Was there a particular type of trait in firefighters that they were looking for?                 Although I am unsure of why they chose these SNPs, the processing of the samples is sound. The use of the PPI-SF is proper as this test is only normed on normal subjects and not psychopaths or jail populations. The Tower of Hanoi test was administered properly. The issue I have is there are a lot of jumps in logic that are not well explained by the author. He makes leaps in his conclusions and manipulates the data in a questionable manner in order to get some sort of correlation between the SNPs, the results on the PPI-SF, and the Tower of Hanoi test. The data itself, in its raw form, may someday prove valuable, the same way genetic mapping with schizophrenics, provides databases of material that may someday unlock the mystery of the illness. That said I do not really understand the author's conclusions which are based on arbitrary alleles (or they are not explained well enough so they seem arbitrarily chosen to the reader of the article), performance measures on the Tower of Hanoi test that measure executive functioning and ability to plan, and the PPI-SF which measures psychopathic traits in a normal population. Coupled with a small sample size, the conclusions require a leap of faith to accept and I feel that they assume causation when they barely meet the standard of correlation.             Comments:The data is valuable because all data collected, especially when you're doing genetic work, can be valuable in the future. The interpretation of the results obtained is questionable at best, and is stretching the conclusions further than I think they can truly go.

Overall the  submission tests a key hypothesis about the concordance between eDNA and eRNA. It will be a welcome addition to the literature.                 The experimental design in this manuscript is solid. In studies such as these it is always difficult to know a priori what levels of replication are required. There are two areas in the experimental design that I would like the authors to elaborate on in their revision (i) the experimental controls in the workflows and (ii) comment about the level of replication used in this study &#8211; be more explicit about the within and between site variability In my general comments below there are a few additional notes regarding experimental design that need addressing .                 When a paper breaks new ground such as this there are a number of outstanding questions, however, the authors have done a solid job of analysing a complex RNA/DNA dataset. As one last caveat it may be prudent to mention that the use of multiple PCR assays may improve the concordance between eRNA and eDNA profiles.             Comments:In the abstract Laroche et al state: Most studies only assess eDNA which, unlike eRNA, can persist in the environment after cell death This statement is not accurate &#8211; RNA has been isolated from a number of substrates long dead (e.g. ancient maize) . the statement need to be revised to talk about the relative stability. Alternatively, the authors should speak to the unlikelihood of RNA surviving long in marine environments.Abstract: &#8216;Therefore, DNA data do not necessarily reflect recent environmental change leading some researchers to advocate for the use of eRNA as an additional, or perhaps superior proxy for portraying ecological changes&#8217; this sentence need to be re-written &#8211; I think the authours are trying to say that RNA may provide a more immediate census of the environment (than DNA) due to its relative stability.Abstract &#8220;Based on these findings, we recommend that metabarcoding-based biomonitoring studies should, whenever applicable, be assessed using both eDNA and eRNA material&#8221; I think this statement need moderating &#8211; stating that there are some benefits to both and this is the ideal scenario, but that ultimately costs, specialised sample collections (to preserve RNA)  and simplicity of workflows may need to be factored.Line 86: replace &#8216;better&#8217; with a more fitting descriptor.Line 174 &#8211; Some more information is needed on the cDNA synthesis, it is unclear if the author used hexamers, targeted primers etc. Latter in the manuscript hexamers are discussed but I could not find it in the methods.Line 187 &#8211; it is unclear if PCR replicates were conducted across all 72 amplicons?The Authors have submitted the raw data to SRA but what about the filtered set? Perhaps consider putting the data up on Data Dryad? This is important if someone wanted to test (or reanalyze) the dataset.Figure 1b is quite a strange layout &#8211; almost an empty box I would advise a re-think of this figure.Figure 2 &#8211; It would be good to put eRNA and eDNA above the venn diagrams. I realize this is shown in the legend but it would be easier to read with &#8216;tags&#8217; above the appropriate Venn.There is not much information in the paper about controls. What turned up in the experimental controls?Line 367 &#8211; it may be good to advocate for an RNA control (e.g. synthetic oligo) to help controls for RT-error. It could well be that the &#8216;simple&#8217; removal of singletons is not sufficient in eRNA datasets. I am not proposing any further experiments but it seems that until the intrinsic error rates are determined that there will be severe difficulties in accurate comparisons of eDNA/eRNA datasets.Line 400-405. While I don&#8217;t disagree with this hypothesis it could also be that populations of these abundant bacteria simply have more polymorphisms. It is a difficult problem to address, but simply removing singletons may be a blunt way to filter for artifacts especially for reads closely related to highly abundant OTUs. Some discussion on appropriate cut-offs to maximise signal:noise might be appropriate here.Line 411, are there any other bacteria consistent with human waste? This is a pretty speculative stuff as there are a number of locations that &#8216;human&#8217; bacterial can originate from (including contamination).Line 446. There are also a lot of differences in copy number and this could easily influence the proportions and composition of eDNA/eRNA datasets like this.Discussion.

", "This manuscript aims to address an important scientific question, mainly the use of eDNA and eRNA in environmental assessment of benthic sediment habitats proximate to offshore oil production sites. However, unlike other published eDNA/eRNA studies, the present manuscript suffers from fatal flaws in terms of sampling design, data processing, and conclusions drawn from the underlying data.From an organizational perspective, the manuscript is appropriately structured in terms of manuscript sections, figures, and tables. The writing is clear and does not require further proofreading for language or grammar.For the most part the authors have cited a robust body of literature focused on combined eDNA/eRNA studies. However, I found references in other areas to be a bit lacking (e.g. justification of bioinformatics choices, supporting evidence for conclusions), and some citations provided to support speculation that in my view was not supported by the data on hand (e.g. Metazoan OTUs chalked up to extracellular DNA).                 The experimental design is extremely limiting given the overarching questions driving this study - in my view, it fails to include appropriate checkpoints and controls that would enable robust assessment of the variables and environmental factors which may be impacting the observed microbial community patterns. My major concerns regarding experimental design are as follows:- Only 6 sites (for a total of 18 samples) were assessed during this study. This does not give nearly enough statistical power in terms of drawing ecological conclusions relevant for seabed monitoring; currently across the field, other benthic studies are assessing upwards of a hundred samples (sometimes thousands) per study.- A Van Veen grab was used to collect samples, which is a fairly harsh sampling method (compared to box cores or multi/mega-corers) since it disrupts the sediment-water interface and would bias the recovery of benthic organisms. If the goal is to assess oil production impacts, a more sensitive sampling method would be preferable (e.g. multi-cores, push cores from ROVs) in order to capture as much of the benthic community as possible.- DNA was only extracted from 2g of sediment (for a total of 36g of sediment extracted during the entire study). This would be OK (and standard practice) for assessing bacterial communities, but it is not likely to do a good job recovering a broad swath of the benthic eukaryotic community, especially meiofauna or macrofauna where a larger volume of sediment is needed to accurately capture the community (e.g. which the authors acknowledge, in their morphological methods where a larger volume of sediment is sieved for macrofauna).- The parallel morphological methods (macrofauna identification) are not really comparable to the eDNA work, at least for eukaryotes - the methods in this study would only do a good job of assessing protist taxa in the 2g of sediment, and eDNA samples do not assess a large enough sample volume to capture the benthic meiofauna or macrofauna community fractions. Furthermore, the macrofaunal morphology is hardly discussed in the results and discussion, and so I am not sure why this was included in the first place.- The authors did not include any negative controls or blank samples to assess the potential contribution of the microbes in PCR/sequencing kits and reagents. Blank samples are becoming standard practice - given the variable eRNA signal and stringent OTU filtering strategy employed here, I suspect the authors may actually be enriching for kit contaminant taxa (but there is no way to assess this because of the lack of blank/control samples - see Salter et al. 2014 https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-014-0087-z) - The bioinformatics methods may be removing real biological signal from the dataset. For example, on Line 217 the authors are using BLAST to assign taxonomy to eDNA/eRNA OTUs, requiring 97% similarity in their matches. Subsequently, &#8220;Operational Taxonomic Units with no match were discarded&#8221; - this is a very misguided strategy because 1) marine benthic environments would not be well represented in the databases, so most taxa are likely to have low matches (&lt;95%) to the database, and 2) OTUs with high match percentages (&gt;97%) have a higher likelihood of belonging to lab contaminants, which are likely to be well represented in public databases. Here, the authors could filter out kit control OTUs if they had included blank samples, but this is not possible given the study design.- Given the above concerns, I cannot be confident in the downstream informatics comparisons (untrimmed vs. trimmed by singletons vs. trimmed by shared OTUs). These comparisons may be rather arbitrary given the lack of blank control samples and the lack of in-depth exploration of any other data patterns (e.g. looking at low-level taxonomy across families, genera, etc. - at the moment everything is summarized at a very high level, and it is difficult to relate the microbial community patterns to actual biological or ecological phenomena).                 This manuscript does not hold up as a methods-focused paper. That does not mean the underlying eDNA dataset is not valuable, it just means the study design is not rigorous enough to test the two stated aims of using eDNA/eRNA to assess environmental impacts and exploring the effect of data processing.For example, a large part of the discussion section is spent talking about the errors and problems associated with RNA data - but then the authors go on to conclude that their eRNA data shows the most significant and convincing patterns (without linking these potential patterns to contamination, errors, etc. introduced because of their study design). There are other issues with the supporting evidence provided in the discussion - many observed patterns are spuriously linked to &#8220;PCR or sequencing errors&#8221; without any data provided to support this fact (e.g. line 404 - not all OTUs removed via bioinformatics filtering would be erroneous sequences; abundance-based filtering will arbitrarily remove biologically valid OTUs. The authors did not rigorously look for errors in their data via their bioinformatics workflow, at least as far as I can tell). In addition, metazoan OTUs are attributed to extracellular material (line 418) without acknowledging the likely presence of diverse meiofauna and protist specimens that would likely be present in the sediment samples.I would suggest completely overhauling this manuscript to focus on the biological patterns - looking deeply at taxonomic patterns and framing this study in a more ecological context is the only way to overcome the current shortcomings in methodology and study design. However, even with such an overhaul the authors would have to seriously revisit their bioinformatics workflow and parameters to be more rigorous and in line with other recent studies in the field. For example, one interesting pattern worth exploring further would be the separation of Near Field vs. Far Field sample sites (consistent across bacteria and eukaryote eDNA PCoAs in Figure 4). What specific taxa are driving this pattern?             Comments:Other minor comments:- Line 181: How were these primer sets chosen? Do they represent standard metabarcoding regions (e.g. Earth Microbiome Project recommended primers?)- Line 183: What is the amplicon length of 16S and 18S amplicons? - Line 324 - There is no such thing as &#8220;near significant&#8221; p-values. p=0.06 and p=0.07 are not significant- Line 326 - Please report p-values here in the text, since you state they are significant.

There were substantial differences in the shape of individual foveae, which corresponds to the variance among individuals observed in psychophysical measurements(He et al. 1999).

The pattern formed by the outer segments was of an even higher complexity.The authors talk about the area, but they do not deal anything on amount of cells either as an absolute number or percentage or any other ratio of curved cells compared to &#8220;regular&#8221; cells. It must be assumed that all the cells showed the reported morphology? If not, what about to perform an statistical analysis of data.Another example is:Results, line 263In addition, the central foveolar cone outer segments (52 &#956;m) were twice as long as the cone outer segments in the parafovea (26 &#956;m).Is there any numerical assessment for this assertion, i.e how many long outer segments out of 100 or whichever amount of cone outer segments?Also, the conclusions are well stated, but it looks to me that in some points is too much speculative, specifically in:Discussion, line 306As light propagation by M&#252;ller cells through the retina (Franze et al. 2007) has been shown to be important and increases photon absorption specifically by cones (Labin et al. 2014), we hypothesize that light hitting the M&#252;ller cell plateau at an angle of 0 degrees is effectively transmitted into the photoreceptors whereas light hitting the M&#252;ller cell plateau at a different angle is partly reflected accordingly, which reduces the amount of light guided through the M&#252;ller cells.

I have major concerns in this regard, mainly related on the superficial genome analysis, as detailed in my comments to the authors (Section B, point 4).             Comments:Overview:The manuscript by Henson and colleagues reports on the physiological characterization and genome sequence analysis of 4 closely related Ch(VI)-tolerant Microbacterium sp. isolates recovered from a contaminated site in IN. Based on the analysis of growth curves and time-dependent Cr(VI) reduction in the presence of 2mM Cr(VI) the authors show differences among the strains in Cr(VI) tolerance and reduction capacity. As a matter of fact, one of the key findings the authors claim to have made is the link observed between Cr(VI) reduction capacity of their isolates and with the resistance phenotype.The authors also determined biolog-based of metabolic profiles of the 4 strains to extend the phenotypic/physiologic characterization. Finally, draft genome sequences were generated for each isolate and automatically annotated at the IMG server and the resulting annotations refined for chromate reduction and resistance determinants by means of blast-based searching of the genomes against members of two well characterized chromate reductase families (ChrR from Pseudomonas putida and YieF from E. coli) and the ChrA efflux pump. Only the latter approach succeeded in identifying ChrR and YieF homologues in the query genomes.A. General Comments.The manuscript has a good introduction on the impact of Cr as a major environmental pollutant and its bio-remediation strategies using microbes. However, not much background information is provided on the mining of bacterial, and specifically Microbacterium genomes, regarding chromate reduction and resistance determinants. The  genes and mechanisms involved, relevant to the genome analysis performed by the authors, should be explicitly stated in the introduction instead of burying them in reference lists. In other words, an effort needs to be made to better relate key background information with the relevant findings of their study. This important information should not be buried in long reference lists. The manuscript is well and clearly written, although it may be a bit too verbose. The quality of the artwork can certainly be improved and associated legends are not always clear or explicit enough for understanding without reference to the main text, as will be detailed below. My major concerns are related to the superficial genome analyses performed.B. Major comments1. Lines (L10-13) of the abstract are vague and even misleading. I don't think that the authors have performed a detailed analysis of the (genomic) differences displayed by the 4 strains. They don't state the main specific findings of the study: link observed between Cr(VI) reduction capacity of their isolates and with the resistance phenotype; presence of ChrR and YieF homologues in the genome sequences &#8230;). What about efflux pumps?\t 2. Section on Genome Annotation (starting at L175). I think that the title of the section is misleading, as the focus is only on detection homolougues of the ChrR and YieF chromate reductases. The procedure is not clear and even cumbersome. What strategy did the authors use to generate the ChrA, ChrR and YieF specific databases? Did they use text-based queries or homology-based (i.e. blast-based) queries of the the UniprotKB \tDB? Why did the authors use blastx of the contigs against the custom Dbs, instead of using the \ttranslation products of the CDSs identified by the HMMs (gene prediction software) run by the IMG pipeline for direct blastp searching against the ChrA, ChrR and YieF specific databases? \tWhat query coverage did the authors impose in their blast searches. Filtering by e-value (1-e-5) is highly prone to selecting spurious hits, that have only local (domain-specific) homology. Given the large genetic distance between the well characterized ChrA ChrR and YieF reference proteins (mainly from Gammaproteobacteria) to the query genomes (Actinobacteria), a much more sensitive approach would have been to run hmmer3 searches using family-specific HMMs.3. Section on Genomic characterization of the isolates (starting at L236)The authors state in the L157-160 that they used 3 programs (AbySS, Velvet and a5) to assemble their genomes and selected the best one for downstream analyses. But the authors don't state which assembler produced the best assemblies. A comparative table in supplementary materials could clarify this. 4. Results section starting at L260 (Genomic annotation of Cr resistance and reduction determinants)The tables 1 and 2 are really of little use. I would repleace them by a proper phylogenetic analysis of bona-fide homologues of the ChrR and YieF protein families, adequately describing the global level of identity and query coverage. Are there multiple copies of  ChrR and YieF family members in the genomes under study? Are they recovered in monophyletic clusters containing characterized chromate reductases? What about the genomic context of the putative ChrR and YieF homologues in your strains? Is there evidence of microsynteny around the target genes that further supports the inforence of homology? Some comparative genome maps of these key regions would be very useful. Is there evidence for horizontal movement of these reductases? It is striking that the putative Cr-K1W homologue displays only 35% identity with the other Microbacterium proteins. And what about such homologues in other Microbacterium genomes? Again, comprehensive, well-designed and performed phylogenetic analysis could illuminate all these questions. And what about ChrA homologues? No mention of their presence in the target strains is made. It is certainly the interplay between efflux pumps and Cr reductases what confers the observed phenotype. By the way, there are 6 large efflux pump superfamilies (RND, MATE, MFS, ABC &#8230;). To what superfamily does ChrA belong? Many have a very broad substrate specificity. I don't think the authors can claim that only ChrA is involved in Cr efflux (L214). This has to be studied in much greater detail. What is the repertoire of efflux pumps in your strains?The discussion on all these issues needs to be improved and deepened. The authors just scratch on the very surface of this complex issue. The result is an almost trivial discussion lacking adequate depth and rigor, based on a very superficial genome analysis.B. Minor comments.L54-55.

If so, completely remove that axis and properly state in the figure caption.L224-225: strain Cr-K20 in mentioned in both lines. Is this correct?L282. Query identity? The identity is always defined for pairwise comparisons. It is completely unclear if you are meaning local, blast-hit identity or global identities from global alignments. In general, what query coverage did the authors impose in their blast searches. Filtering by e-value (1-e-5) is highly prone to selecting spurious hits, that have only local (domain-specific) homology, as commented previously.L168,493 and 496.

"], "10.7717/peerj.6450": ["The manuscript describes trends in fragmentation and connectivity of grasslands in the Buenos Aires province, Argentina using 5 satellite images from 1974 to 2016. The introduction is well developed and sets the scene with adequate references. Figures are relevant but could be improved with more detailed captions. I appreciate providing the raw data to the readers so they can replicate the steps described in the paper.                 The design setup is within the scope of the journal, research questions are well defined and relevant. The method section provides many details on the data preparation but very little detail on the actual processing of the data, esp. for connectivity. Since the topic of the paper is about trend analysis, the reader expects to find sufficient details describing how exactly that trend analysis was conducted but right now there is not much information about this topic.Similar to Connectivity, the notion of fragmentation is a very wide field and the authors should explain why they have chosen MSPA for their analysis, or which features of MSPA are considered to provide more appropriate information compared to typical Fragstats indices, as used in the Lara &amp; Gandini paper 2014 (in the supplemental data). For example, I could imagine that the MSPA-exclusive information on core-areas, islets and connecting pathways and their direct relation to network theory analysis used to calculate the degree of network connectivity, was a decisive argument.                 The findings are sound, relevant and to my knowledge new in the field. However, I think the paper would benefit from additional information and/or reasoning on the chosen settings for scale, MSPA-settings, and connectivity assessment.a) In the introduction you mention the importance of spatial scale, which is good. But where and how is this topic addressed in your analysis? b) MSPA analysis:- you seem to have used an older GTB version of the 2.6 series. Please note that a small bug in the MSPA statistics calculation has been fixed and more recent versions also provide information on different type of perforations within Core area, a topic which is of interest when talking about fragmentation. You could reprocess the 5 images (only takes some seconds) to get updated and enhanced MSPA information for your 5 images. - you use EdgeWidth=3, why did you opt for a 3-pixel edge width, because that corresponds to roughly 100m (90m to be precise)?- you selected to divide core-areas into small/medium/large using the default settings of 1000 and 4600 pixels. Can you explain why you choose to show the core-area distinction and why you used the two thresholds and not others, for example 1000 and 10000? Maybe you use the distinction to visually highlight the locations of large/medium/small core areas and/or analyse how these types have changed over time?c) connectivity analysisYou may add some comments on connectivity. Similar to fragmentation, connectivity is not good or bad, and it strongly depends on the selected species. The same habitat can be well connected for one species but not connected at all for another species. The ECA as calculated via GTB looks at the overall structural connectivity between the set of network components (Core + bridges but excluding all the other MSPA classes) accounting for their area and the number of nodes and links within each component. Because of this definition, ECA provides a measure which is not species-specific and as such an independent overall measure of connectivity.The supplemental raw data supplied is somewhat confusing:- Binary images are provided for 1974, 1988, 2000, 2011, 2016: all images should be provided in byte format instead of integer to allow reproducing the analysis within GTB.Looking in the subfolder \"frequency\" we find that the actual image for 1974 is actually from 1975 with the name \"pajonal1975_r\", which must be in byte format. Maybe better to provide the actual data you used in your analysis instead of the integer formatted image \"1974.tif\"- The information in the subfolder \"GToolbox\" is superfluous as it is identical to the one in the subfolder \"frequency\" - the purpose of the paper in the subfolder \"Paper\" is unclear to me, or please add an explanation why it is needed as supplemental material.             Comments:The paper describes dynamics in Pq grassland fragmentation and connectivity. But the title puts a strong focus on MSPA without mentioning fragmentation and connectivity. If the importance is MSPA then maybe there should be a dedicated section on MSPA, highlighting why this and not any other methodology was chosen. Or the maybe the title could be changed to better reflect the actual focus of the paper, something like:Trends in fragmentation and connectivity of Paspalum quadrifarium grasslands in the Buenos Aires province, Argentina.Specific remarks at line number:25: correct: Guidos Toolbox -&gt; GuidosToolbox (GTB), then any later reference can be: GTB27: We found a loss in total coverage area, number of habitat nuclei and a reduction in connectivity.

A suggestion: In addition to Figure 2 it might be interesting to show the area change (morphological change detection) from 1974 to 2016, showing where, and how much, grassland cover was lost/gained and where it remained unchanged.

Why not all years?- What can be gleaned from these maps exactly, it is difficult to tell. Needs more explanation about what is being seen. MSPA is a useful method but needs to be contextualized and analysed further, simply producing these maps without providing a more detailed summary analysis (e.g., what do the numbers in table 1 mean?) is not really useful.

This is an important question for retrospective monitoring and such analysis would fill an important knowledge gap regarding baseline for antibiotic resistance prevalence in the environment.&#8226;\tAlthough the scope is small (onty two genes &#8211; sul1 and tetW &#8211;&#160;are investigated) this is an important proof-of-concept study, and it conforms to methodological standards.&#8226;\tHowever, the qPCR for the non-seedbank community would need a better description.&#8226;\tFurthermore, it must be described how the chemical analysis for Mn and Fe in the sediments was carried out. Now, this analysis is just mentioned in passing on lines 241-242 in the manuscript.                 &#8226;\tThe data underlying the results seem to be robust and statistically sound.&#8226;\tHowever, I have a major problem with one of the conclusions by the authors. The idea that tet(W) abundance would be a result of antibiotic pollution (or pollution by human bacteria carrying tet(W) genes) seem quite farfetched to me, given that the lake at the same time (according the authors) underwent eutrophication. Since eutrophication would lead to more anaerobic conditions, and the bacteria co-enriched with tet(W) are obligate anaerobes it seems that the explanation to the tet(W) increase would be increased abundances of these bacteria &#8211; not a selection for tet(W) by antibiotic residues. Indeed, some of these bacteria are known to harbour the tet(W) gene. If the authors want to make claims along the lines of &#8220;tetracycline exposure caused selection for tet(W) in the sediment communities&#8221;, they need to support this hypothesis with chemical measurements of tetracycline in the sediments.&#8226;\tThe paragraph on lines 278-301 is entirely speculative, but is presented as if it was well supported by the results.

In my opinion, the use of stacked histograms and scales on the graphs are not the best way to communicate their results.                 I could not reconcile certain features of the experimental design.  The first was the selection of species and the number of different species used.  The rationale for these species is provided on lines 92 to 100, but it was not clear why two species were used and its relevance to the goals of the study outlined in lines 79 to 85.   This needs to be better explained.I am also concerned about the scale of the manipulations on the dependent parameter (1 and 2 C).  No information was reported on the variation in these parameters.  This should be reported so readers have confidence that fish subject to these different treatments were really exposed to different thermal regimes.  This becomes particularly important for the longer term results so that readers can have confidence that the result was due to behavioural plasticity and not convergence of the thermal regimes.                 The manipulations of temperature were put into the climate change scenario outlined in the introduction but the magnitude of these changes gave me several pragmatic concerns.   The first was the practicality of such a small experimental manipulation.  For there to be a real experimental effect there must be no overlap between the 3 conditions (29, 30 &amp; 31).  For this it is important to report the variation in temperature associated with the three conditions and that data was not presented.

Comments:The manipulations of temperature were put into the climate change scenario outlined in the introduction but the magnitude of these changes gave me several pragmatic concerns.   The first was the practicality of such a small experimental manipulation.  For there to be a real experimental effect there must be no overlap between the 3 conditions (29, 30 &amp; 31).  For this it is important to report the variation in temperature associated with the three conditions and that data was not presented.

Figures are clear.                 a) The researchers state the length of the fish at the end of the treatment, however, it is necessary to state the average lengths in each group.  Did temperature have a difference on growth rate that could account for the minor difference observed?  Since the authors presumably have this data it would make an interesting additional figure. Assuming that the weights were not significantly different, the authors could omit a change in eating pattern brought on by elevated temperature explaining the decrease in responsiveness. b)  It should be stated in the methods how often and what the fish were fed during the duration of the experiment.  c) More details about the housing of the fish are necessary.  Were they housed in flow-through tanks?  Were they housed individually (Damselfish have a tendency to be territorial and aggressive so hopefully this was the case)?  How was the temperature maintained and adjusted?  How often were temperature measurements made in the holding tanks?  What kind of temperature probe was used?d) Why is temperature measured only in whole numbers and not with three significant digits?  The authors should use the same style as Allan et al., 2015 and report to tenths of a degree Celcius.  e) What was the approximate age of the fish?  A reader can work backwards and try to figure this out but it would help to simply state this around line 100-101f)Was the gender of the fish observed?  This should be stated even if this was not determined.g) What was the temperature of the testing arena? Was the water in the arena the same temperature as the experimental group? Was fresh water used for every fish?                 No comment             Comments:This is a very well written and designed study.  With a few minor additions to the paper I would strongly recommend this paper for publication.A few other minor points:-The authors use the term &#8216;behavioral decisions&#8217; in the abstract which implies higher order cognitive processing, however this was not tested.  Where have the authors tested the decision making ability of the fish? This should be revised to reflect the findings in the manuscript.  &#8216;Behavioral response&#8217; would seem more appropriate.  -Be consistent with &#8216;behavior&#8217; (ex. in the abstract) and &#8216;behaviour&#8217; (line 43)-Line 96 &#8211; space needed in the reference                                                ", "The article is concise and to the point, though a number of important details (though minor changes) regarding experimental design are either missing or should be elaborated on.

The understood absence of a time control is concerning and should be explicitly acknowledged, but not fatal.                 I make a number of suggestions relating to the analysis, which I believe will better convey the data. The conclusions do appear to be supported by the data.             Comments:The paper outlines the effect of elevated temperature on performance of escape responses in two damselfish species. The data appears rigorously collected and the interpretation appropriately supported by the data. The writing on the whole is concise and on point. However, I do think the clarity of the paper could be significantly improved before publication, involving various suggestions relating to each the analysis, and clarifications in the information provided that I believe will make the paper easier to interpret.A binomial glm(m) would more explicitly describe your data. You can then simultaneously look at the effects of different treatment durations and temperatures, with estimations to describe the importance of each parameter, alike your ANOVA of normally distributed data. This will also yield more informative effect size estimates which could better inform any predictions you wish to make of the effect climate change may have. This is of course not relevant to the 3 level response variable and a multinomial (while possible) is probably more trouble than it is worth. On request I can send sample code for a binomial glm(m) in R.Please define and describe the &#8220;repeated/able drop stimulus&#8221;. I am not familiar with this term.ANOVA output (including effect sizes) should be included so potential meta-analyses can use your work (line 193).

Please add to complement lines 124-5 and show the relative breakdown of sample sizes across treatments.I would appreciate more information on the ecology of the two species and site (where available).1)\tWhat are the natural temperature ranges of the species, that of the collection site, the range of temperatures from the recruitment sites around your site (ln 99)?2)\tAre there large life-history differences between species e.g. longer larval stages which may allow for long migration?3)\tHow much warming has your site already seen? Ie. Is the baseline &#8216;control&#8217; historic temperature or just current temperature?4)\tHow largely distributed are the two species?5)\tHow separate are the two species taxonomically within the genus?This could all lead to rather intuitive predictions on their potential to plastically respond to different thermal regimes and the robustness of the metapopulation or species and aid the comparability with the broader ecological literature. Addressing this up front would then allows for a more compelling discussion on perhaps why you see the differences between species (while being careful not to sell ideas as a priori hypotheses). 24: adaptive a better word than beneficial?51: &#8220;changes *to the* phenotype&#8221;Can also lead to chronic stress too. Can setup that different species may react differently.87: maybe move this to end of experimental methods?Paragraph starting 92: Personally, I&#8217;d like to see this elaborated on and combined with the last paragraph of the introduction.108: Future studies could improve the power and gain further information by collecting the data longitudinally, with repeated measures through time of individual fish.115: There may be substantially more micro-environmental variation than AIMS picks up.112-115: Feeding regime belongs here. Energy budgets could be very important to the likelihood of escape, particularly at elevated temperature of an ectotherm.124: Do you have Control fish taken at 4-days and 90-days as well? This could be important for controlling for time in captivity effects and should be explicitly acknowledged as a limitation if not.136: &#8220;in *an* attempt&#8221;150-1: On first attempt, or any attempt?152-3: What constitutes &#8220;away&#8221;? 180 degrees?170: Presumably you just mean the random effect for the ANOVA? On what basis was it dropped? AIC or P-value? Seems somewhat superfluous information as you do not present the model.216-7: Control treatment being natural conditions?244: I&#8217;d suggest the energy demands of more C-starts would be somewhat negligible in comparison to the general increase in maintenance costs of an ectotherm living in higher temperatures. Regardless, the paragraph seems somewhat tangential.254: I&#8217;d suggest breaking this down into a multilevel analyses (inc. data collection) could also be highly beneficial. Some genotypes/individuals will be more responsive (or &#8216;plastic&#8217;) than others, allowing selection to act on plasticity. Plasticity through the larval stage or parental effects could be predictive of reef temperatures and already informing adult phenotypes. -\tDavid Mitchell                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.2940": ["There are some tense and sentence structure issues throughout the manuscript.

The theoretical underpinning to the paper is Watson&#8217;s carative factors and patient satisfaction.  The survey methods and results are well supported by tables presenting research instruments and results. The paper needs proof reading and some re-structuring especially in relation to paragraph construction to assist the reader in following the detailed information being presented. The text, tables and figures also need to be closely aligned. Some additional references have been suggested (see line 58 and 59 for example) on the role of education and its relationship to nurses&#8217; personal characteristics and caring behaviours (e.g. Snowden A , Stenhouse R et al [2015] The relationship between emotional intelligence, previous caring experience and mindful ness in student nurses and midwives: a cross sectional analysis, Nurse Education Today, 35, 152-158)                 The authors need to explain the rationale for their convenience sample to recruit nurses and their purposive sample to recruit patients and their choice of institutions. Issues of validity and generalizability of the findings need to be considered in the design.                 Validity of findings It would be helpful if the authors could comment on the construct validity of the questionnaires in relation to nurses&#8217; and patients&#8217; perceptions of carative factors &#8211; in other words are the Caring Nurse-Patient Interactions Scale and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey measuring the same construct?Could this be one reason for the lack of congruence between nurse participants&#8217; and patients&#8217; perceptions (see Lines 294-297) Line 97 - Patient satisfaction is assumed to be a response to nurses&#8217; caring but other factors related to the patient could be influencing their perceptions.Lines 119-221 - There is a huge difference between the number of nursing assistants and number of nurses taking part in the survey which reflects the nursing workforce in Slovenia. The carative factor &#8216;sensibility (Line 269) was shown to differ between the two groups suggesting that the level of education was the reason for this. The role of institutional factors and how they impact on nurses&#8217; and nursing assistants' individual characteristics is an important discussion point. Could the authors speculate on these possible factors using the institutions where differences were observed as exemplars? (See lines 290-291 and 308) The authors may be interested in research undertaken to show the influence of different levels of nurse education on nursing performance described in Wile A et al (1997) Measuring clinical nurse performance: development of the King's Nurse Performance Scale. International Journal of Nursing Studies 34 (3):222-230 Line 277 - The authors state that nursing practice in Slovenia is based on Virginia Henderson&#8217;s theory. This needs referencing and a brief explanation of the theory and how it both differs and is similar to Watson&#8217;s theory. This is important for the validity of the findings. Lines 302-304 refer to the value patients place on the different types of caring (technical/instrumental over expressive/affective care). In the light of this finding the authors may find the following paper of interest (Bone 2008 Epidurals not Emotions: the care deficit in US maternity care. In: Hunter B and Deery R (eds) Emotions in Midwifery and Reproduction. Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan). The paper also highlights the negative influence of financial constraints on shaping modern health care which may be relevant to interpreting the findings On Line 339 the authors state &#8216;Delivering care without caring is wrong&#8217; (citing Douglas 2010). This is a fairly blunt statement and I would suggest the authors rewrite this sentence in a more nuanced way.             Comments:This is an interesting paper and shows the importance of quantitative survey research for describing conceptually complex issues and flagging up research questions for further research using mixed methods. These points could be emphasised further throughout and especially in the conclusion. The paper needs proof reading throughout.

For example, in the abstract under \"Results\" the author states Carative factor sensibility was related to the level of nursing education.  But then under the abstract \"Discussion\" the author states that she did not find major significant differences between carative factors and level of nursing education.

In fact, an additional citation should be included:Gsponer, J&#246;rg, et al. \"Tight regulation of unstructured proteins: from transcript synthesis to protein degradation.\" Science 322.5906 (2008): 1365-1368.The author is advised to include only those citations that first suggest and/or confirm the association between phosphorylation and intrinsic disorder.                 Overall, the experimental design looks good. In particular, the author has taken care to ensure that biases from disorder predictors do not affect the final results. However, there are three concerns:&#8226;\tThe choice of M. tuberculosis for all the experiments needs to be motivated more clearly. The author states that the presence of high disorder and high pS/T content determined the choice of species. However, as the author points out in the supplementary table, there are other species that have both high disorder content and levels of phosphorylation. On a related note, there are other bacterial data sets as well: van Noort, Vera, et al. \"Cross&#8208;talk between phosphorylation and lysine acetylation in a genome&#8208;reduced bacterium.\" Molecular systems biology 8.1 (2012).&#8226;\tIt is not clear why a randomization test was chosen to assign statistical significance to the proportion of phosphosites in disordered regions when a simple Chi-square or Fisher&#8217;s exact test would have sufficed. In fact, the author has done this in supplementary table 1 and an additional test seems redundant. It is suggested that the author either clarify the need for this test or remove the redundancy by reporting the P-value from the Fisher test.&#8226;\tThere are a few important issues regarding the conservation analysis that concern me:1.\tDifferent proteins evolve at different rates and a simple fraction of conserved residues at a given position does not take this into account. The conservation at a position in the protein needs to be normalized with respect to the entire protein&#8217;s conservation. Gray and Kumar address this in their 2011 paper.2.\tWhile the conservation levels of pS/T and S/T are not significantly different, they seem to be highly conserved in general (in ~5 out of the 7 species considered). This is probably due to the choice of species. I am not aware of divergence times in this genus, but the farther back in time you go, a clearer signal is likely to emerge. In fact, the studies cited by the author considered long evolutionary distances in eukaryotes. An alternative would be to use an unbiased approach by performing a reciprocal BLAST search against the entire nr database.3.\tD and E residues are considered to be phosphomimetic residues [Pearlman, Samuel M., Zach Serber, and James E. Ferrell Jr. \"A mechanism for the evolution of phosphorylation sites.\" Cell 147.4 (2011): 934-946.] and positions with changes to or from these residues should ideally be excluded.                 &#8226;\tThe findings from the conservation analysis need to be placed in the context of previous work. In eukaryotes, the question of whether pS/T are more conserved than S/T has been debated for a while now. While the papers cited in line 119 do show that they are indeed more conserved, but work from Landry et al. shows no difference in evolutionary rates. This ambiguity underscores the importance of the above point on the conservation analysis.&#8226;\tThe statements in lines 135 and 141 on the similarity between M. tuberculosis and eukaryotic species in terms of phosphosite-disorder associations needs to be explained a bit more. Perhaps, the author can list out some proportion values for eukaryotic species to show that this is indeed the case. It would also be good if the author can comment on the results here in the context of similar previous works.&#8226;\tWhile the statement in Line 143 is intended to be speculation, it is worded strangely. To me, it is saying, &#8216;Phosphosites in M. tuberculosis cannot be associated with intrinsically disordered regions without high amounts of intrinsically disordered regions in the proteome&#8217;. This is akin to saying that this species has a high number of pS/T, which was already established in the 'Introduction' section.             Comments:This paper addresses an interesting question through a well-reasoned computational approach. However, the conservation analysis needs to be done more carefully with the eukaryotic debate in mind. Finally, the author needs to improve the manuscript with respect to the minor and major issues with the writing, especially in the &#8216;Discussion&#8217; section.

Comments:The manuscript by Gajinder Pal Singh focuses on the observations that the proteome of M. tuberculosis has both (a) relatively high disorder content and (b) relatively high number of phosphoS/Ts, and establishes a relationship between the two, as has been previously shown for eukaryotes. Overall, the manuscript is well written, but leaves me wondering if the author is missing an opportunity to make a stronger claim about disorder and pS/Ts in bacteria? Suppl. Table S1 and discussion (lines 144-6) list two bacteria in addition to the M. tuberculosis where % disorder tracks with significant enrichment of disordered pS/T sites. Are the species in Suppl. Table S1 all for which there are experimental phos sites? Do predicted pS/T sites track well with experimental sites in these species? If so, doing a large scale predictive experiment might make sense.Also left unexplored is the relationship between pS/T and pH/D in these bacterial species. Are pS/T sites regulatory elements in addition or a substitution for pH/D? Is there a general trend that with % disorder in a bacterial proteome, % pS/T goes up, and % pH/D goes down?Other:In Table S1, Streptomyces coelicolor appears twice?In Figures 1 and 2, in order to provide a sense of variance for % disordered and % S/T sites, the author should include error bars. One way to estimate variance would be bootstrap sampling.

However, all the arguments seem to be made at the phylum level, e.g., 241-256, yet the arthors are making predictions about function.  It would be very helpful if the authors made arguments based on family-level predictions, which is the level for which functional constraints or predictions are made. For example, Fig. 3, would be more meaningful if compared at the family level..  The authors try to discuss, quite a bit, of the genera involved, however, I think it would make more sense to describe families of relevant bacteria throughout and make arguments about function then.  The work on functional predictions would be substantially improved if they performed analysis such as PICRUSt or something similar.                 Again, the findings would be significantly strengthened by also comparing familly-level predictions to modeled findings in PICRUSt             Comments:Again, the findings would be significantly strengthened by also comparing familly-level predictions to modeled findings in PICRUSt            "], "10.7717/peerj.374": ["The English here is good but not great.

Overall comments:1)\tThe Abstract should be updated to explicitly identify what the study did and was about.2)\tThe study occurs in a large reserve, but sampling is limited to a small plot (24 ha).  Therefore, the scale of inference is not for the reserve, but for the plot.  This limits the amount of extrapolation attainable from the study. Review:Abstract:1.\tAbstract states that 20 birds and mammals documented.  True, but only 10 used in analyses.  Please make this explicit.   2.\t&#8220;to estimate the minimum trapping effort actually needed to sample the wildlife community&#8230;in the plot&#8221;.  I think &#8220;in the plot&#8221; should be added, for the community in the Reserve is not fully represented. Please make this explicit.   3.\tThe term &#8220;resident&#8221; should be removed.  Evaluating residency, or transiency, did not happen.  Instead, state that selection on what species to include in the analyses was based on the # pictures taken, with species having # pictures &lt; # excluded from the analyses.4.\tThe sentence &#8220;At our site, the optimal sampling interval for one site was ca. 40 days or long enough to record about 20 independent photographs.&#8221;  What does &#8220;interval for one site&#8221; mean? Perhaps one camera? This result stems from figure 4 and lines 191-194.  But is this really &#8220;optimal&#8221;.  Please make sure this is well explained in the ms (and Abstract). Presently it is not.  Sounds as if one could leave 1 camera for 40 days and that would be fine. This is not true for 1 camera, or for all 19 (19 cams is 28 days as depicted in Figure 3 &amp; in text).5.\tThe sentence &#8220; Analysis shows that rotating cameras to new sites would be a better sampling strategy for measuring species richness than leaving cameras at fewer sites for longer periods&#8221;  This sentence is not quite true.  As I understand it, all cameras were stationary &#8211; no rotation happened.  What was evaluated is an increasing number of additional stationary cameras were evaluated to determine it&#8217;s effect on species richness.  This should be reworded in the Abstract to reflect the actual method.  Line 68 explained this well.Introduction &#8211; Discussion:1)\tLine 83:  That habitats in plot are typical of forests should have a reference.  Maybe the Legendre et al. 2009.   Now, the assumption is that the species in the plot represent the animal community in the reserve.  I don&#8217;t think this assumption can be made.  As above, I think the species accumulation is for the plot only, not the entire reserve.  Please see comment #3 below.2)\tLine 94-96: Cameras stratified by habitat types &#8211; Figure 1 makes it look like the plots are simply the 18 regions of equal area.  Could a sentence (or 2) be added that further explain / summarize this stratification without having to read Legendre et al. 2009?   As I understand it, the camera was placed at a random geographical location in each of the 18 sub units.   However, Line 124 has  19 cameras and not 18?  18 seemed intuitive based on figure 1, but 19 does not.  Please clarify.  The ms could use some more explanation on the above. Optimization was for viewing angle.  Makes sense.  But cameras were not pointed on trails. Why?  If sampling is to maximize capture, why not put them were animals have high activity?  What the authors did is not wrong, but wondering why they decided not to acquire pictures, seemingly faster, when they focus on the more common species anyhow.3)\tThe study occurs in a large reserve, but sampling is limited to a small plot (24 ha).  Therefore, the scale of inference is not for the reserve, but for the plot.  This should be made explicit.  Unfortunately, I think it also limits the amount of inference attainable from the study. Certainly, had more plots been selected, then the authors could have expanded inference to the park.   Therefore I think it would help give this paper more punch if the authors described (few sentences) why this plot was chosen out of the entire reserve.  Simply to help the results have greater relevance to camera trapping in similar situations &amp;/or this reserve.  If I am wrong here, please describe in the ms why I am.4)\tIt would help to make very clear what the study is attempting to do.  For example, MTE on camera traps for species richness. That is explicit.  But for what species is not.  Line 112 on describes some excluded species, but the study has yet to describe what species are included. That does not come out until the Methods and should be sooner &amp; in the Introduction.  Maybe state &#8220;common species&#8221; defined as &#8220;[how you define it would be written in here]&#8221;.5)\tNow on Line 114 &#8211; why exclude the 3 transient animals with occasional visits?  Instead, why not include all the species found in the rarefaction?  Line 161 &#8211; 164.  I still don&#8217;t understand why 7 arboreal and 3 &#8220;transient&#8221; species were removed.  Just because few pictures were taken does not mean the species is not a resident.  Clearly it is present! Given an objective of this study to provide guidance for camera trapping, how would one know what species are transient or resident in a given study site elsewhere?  Certainly, scientists can limit their sample to whatever they choose; I think that by doing so and focusing on more common species limits the study&#8217;s utility. For as we know, rare and elusive species usually have fewest images taken and capturing them are often central to such studies. If I am wrong, please explain why.Perhaps instead of the terms &#8220;resident&#8221; and &#8220;transient&#8221; just leave it as &#8220;We only considered species that had images taken &gt;=10% of the study in our analyses, because&#8230;.[we wanted curves to represent those most abundant&#8230;.or something like this].   And take out the resident / transient verbiage which is subjective.6)\tRegarding the independence of images.  As I understand it, for species accumulation image independence does not matter, but for rarefaction it does, due to the calculations.  I think the ms would benefit by a sentence explaining this.  I think this will from an additional way to help educate readers (and if I got this wrong, then me too). And If I got this right, it may make sense to reorganize the Methods, with doing species accumulation first, followed by independent images and then rarefaction.7)\tLine 147 &#8211; 155:  This section of methods somewhat confused me.  By looking at the contour map, it seems that 1 camera was sampled  for 10 &#8211; 700 days (and done repeatedly with the same and other cameras to get mean values [1,000 times]), and then iteratively up to 19 cameras per day.  Now the legend reads &#8220;because 19 cameras running at once, then each day is 19 camera days&#8221;.  If that is so, then why does the Y axis have # camera sites listed?  And doesn&#8217;t 1 camera running for 400 days get nearly 60% of the 10 species?  Maybe I am making this harder than it is, but perhaps rewording the methods to make this clearer would help.It is somewhat implicit that this comes from the rarefaction but I recommend making more explicit.8)\tLine 190 &#8211; Referring to figure 3: At first I didn&#8217;t understand why it is better to have more sites for shorter time than fewer sites for longer time, if the same result is obtained.  When I closely examined Fig 3, I got it.  For example, at 2000 camera trap days (gray line) one could have 3 cameras at 700 days &amp; 90% of species acquired vs 19 cams at ~100 days and 95% acquired.  Quite a big deal! I would state an example or something like this to make Figure 3 more explicit.  This is a key figure that you made. It deserves more explanation.9)\tFig 4 needs more explanation too.  Looks like each of the cameras is plotted (raw data &#8211; accumulation) and then an average accumulation?  In keeping with your analyses, why not run the rarefaction for each of the 19 cameras and perform a mean on that?.    So, first why look at accumulation and not rarefaction?  Isn&#8217;t the rarefaction a better predictor and reason for using it?  Second, please explain the relevance of why independent photographs matter for predicting species richness in this context and the value of plotting this (panel B).  Overall, more text in the ms should clarify the message of Figure 4, and the legend for Figure 4 to explain the significance of 6.42 and 8.6.   Looks to me that in &#8220;A&#8221; if I run one camera in this plot then after 600+ days I will have 6.42 of the 10 species acquired, and that corresponds to the contours on Figure 3&#8230;So why even have Figure 4 A? 10) Doesn't specaccum provide standard deviation?  I don't necessarily think it relevant unless Figure 4 retains accumulation and not rarefaction.  If it retains accumulation, and a multiple runs ensued then a sense of variability is important and should be included.  Admittedly, this comment stems from some confusion about Figure 4, what it represents, and what it is trying to accomplish.10)\tPaper could use minor grammatical checking throughout.                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.3202": ["The manuscript provides valuable information about bacteria communities in the Pacific coast tick. There is value in which molecular assays can or cannot provide information about the bacterial communities associated with ticks. The methodology used is current with microbiome characterization, but clarifications in the methodology are needed. The results need to focus on the data generated, with the limitations of the methods used. Finally, the discussion should provide a more critical and transparent evaluation of their data in the context of other tick microbiomes.The conclusion section was out of place. While the idea of using symbionts to control the spread of pathogens is intriguing and being developed in the Wolbachia system, the authors did not prepare the reader for these concluding remarks. A better conclusion would focus on the findings and limitations of the study given the data the authors actually present.                 It is not clear how exactly the authors used the preliminary PCR queries for Rickettsia and Francisella bacteria to inform their Illumina sequencing approach. This should be clarified&#8212;it is unclear if ticks were pooled per site, or if individual ticks were sequenced. It is surprising that such low frequencies of Rickettsia and Francisella infection were found by PCR, but such a large percentage of the OTUs were close in identity to Rickettsia and Francisella. It is also unclear what percentage of individual ticks was infected with Rickettsia or Francisella, as revealed by Illumina sequencing. The authors should clarify their methods to address this issue. Negative controls were run in parallel to the DNA extractions (Line 122). It is unclear if these were sequenced in parallel with the tick samples and how the negative controls were used in the data analyses. Many of the differences in site (Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium) may be common contaminants. As the authors address (Lines 392-397) they may just be remnants of the soil community, and while care was taken to surface sterilize the ticks, these potential soil microbes may not be biologically relevant to the tick. The authors should better discuss these bacteria in the context of the biology of the tick to show how the bacteria actually contribute to differentiation by site, and not just an artifact of contamination in the lab. It would also benefit their argument if they can provide evidence for isolation by distance in bacterial communities from other studies.                 The authors stated that Rickettsia and Francisella might interfere with each other (Line 67-76). Understanding competition between endosymbionts is an open question in the field of host-associated microbial ecology. However, 16S rRNA profiling provides relative abundances of sequences, but does not provide measures of competition or an accurate estimate of competitive interference. RNA expression would address this question by looking at transcriptionally active bacteria, and the authors should clarify their conclusions to address this limitation of 16S rRNA profiling (lines 402-413). SourceTracker was a nice idea to figure out what contributed to the bacterial communities in the ticks. However, again, the authors discuss just the co-occurrence of the bacteria (lines 428-437), but the bacteria also seem to be biologically irrelevant to both ticks and dogs. Limitations of this approach should be discussed. Primarily, other studies have sequenced feeding ticks and the blood of the host the ticks was found to determine sources of the tick microbial community. The current discussion of the results from SourceTracker does not seem biologically relevant. I recommend the authors compare their results to those matched with tick and host blood as a better way to examine the source of host-associated microbiomes.             Comments:They authors do a nice job of motivating the importance to public health of microbial surveys in ticks, and provide a survey of the both the pathogens and potential symbionts commonly found in ticks. There is a lot of value in the negative results presented. It is important to the community that identifying the Rickettsia/Francisella symbionts and identification of digested blood meal is difficult with standard PCR.  The authors find that male ticks have more microbial diversity than female ticks, and this is common to other tick microbiome studies. The authors should clarify the life stage of ticks (Line 102). This result is interesting, although the reason is unknown. It is an important consistency in the tick microbiome literature where inconsistency and high variation is common.                                                ", "No comments.                 No comments.                 Given the extremely low R-values, I think the effect of geography (especially given that there are only 4 sites) are a bit overstated (see Line 260 and the very low ANOSIM R-value). The figures show the lack of any substantial effect of geography.             Comments:I have a few minor comments:1) Line 19. Replace non-infectious with non-pathogenic2) Lines 25-26. Might be worth mentioning levels of co-infection of different Rickettsia strains in the same tick here.3) Line 197.

Sure you did everything correctly?7) Seems like some relevant literature of other disease vectors (e.g. fleas, mosquitos) is ignored. I guess I can understand if you only want to focus on ticks, but there has been some other work on fleas that seems relevant to this work (see: Jones, Knight, and Martin. 2013.

There are a few small errors in some of the references which can easily be fixed.                 The experimental design is good and relates to the authors&#8217; goals. There should be more clearly laid out predictions in relation to the more specific questions they tried to answer, e.g. concerning the impact of location and tick sex on microbial community composition.                 The findings are good, but many of the statistical methods were not explicitly described which hinders the validity of the claims. It has been pointed out where this needs to be addressed. An additional way to improve the quality of the sequence data used by accounting for sequences in the negative controls is also suggested.             Comments:In this manuscript, the authors analyze the bacterial communities of adult Dermacentor occidentalis from four different sites near San Diego, CA. The communities were analyzed in relation to endosymbiont infection, Francisella-like endosymbiont, Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia infection, collection site, tick sex, and relation to possible host microbiome. Their goal was to find evidence of interference competition between the endosymbiont and SFGR pathogen infection. They suggest their results show evidence of the hypothesized competition between these two groups of tick-associated bacteria and found some evidence for variation for bacterial community composition by tick sex and collection site, and perhaps some association with host skin microbiome. The implications are the application of endosymbionts as a tick-borne infection control measure.The goals of the paper are interesting, and there are some interesting results, but unfortunately the paper seems to be bogged down by many different kinds of statistical analyses that are somewhat hard to understand, or not explained clearly in the methods section, which makes it hard to be convinced by the authors&#8217; arguments. The paper would benefit from more explanation of the bacterial taxa making up the communities found in these ticks and streamlining the analyses in relation to their predictor variables to better highlight their findings. A more direct presentation of the hypotheses and predictions in relation to the statistical approaches would also help guide the reader through the results and better understand their implications. There also seem to be some small errors in some of the references in the text or in the references section (e.g. correct format of author names, italicized Latin names) which should be corrected. For the current state of the manuscript, I would suggest to reject with an invitation to resubmit after addressing reviewer comments.Specific comments in relation to line numbers are below. Abstract Line 20: What kinds of &#8220;bacteria&#8221; do you mean here? Pathogenic? Endosymbionts? Environmental? Please be more specific. 26-27: How was infection with Francisella quantified? The number of types? Number of sequence copies? For obligate endosymbionts one would assume 100% infection so there could not be sufficient variation to relate to infection with another pathogen. (also see comment on line 298, Figure 4) 31-33: Unless there is an experimental component of the study you cannot say you have found explicit evidence for competitive exclusion. Please change the language to more accurately relate to the association found between these bacteria, not a direction of the interaction. 32: Change position of commas to: &#8220;&#8230;FLEs and, to a lesser extent, other bacteria interfere with&#8230;&#8221; Introduction 40-41: &#8220;&#8230;three-host tick&#8221;? I have not heard this term before, since ticks all need three hosts to transition between each lifestage. A more useful description would be to note it is a hard tick (as opposed to soft tick). Also, change to &#8220;vertebrates&#8221; or &#8220;vertebrate hosts&#8221;, since &#8220;animals&#8221; can include invertebrates. 57: First name of author in reference? Seems to be a mistake. 58-60: Unclear what you mean here, what &#8220;Francisella bacteria&#8221; do you mean? All Francisella are bacteria. 67-68: Wording of the sentence makes it unclear if you mean interactions between multiple Rickettsia endosymbionts or between them and other sorts of bacteria that infect ticks. 76: A concluding sentence would be useful here. Why does the interaction between endosymbionts and pathogens matter? 89-91: This hypothesis assumes the endosymbionts and pathogens share the same infection site within the tick in order to compete, which is not always the case. Can you give further evidence as to why this should happen in this system? Also, many symbionts are obligate and therefore there would not be much variation in prevalence (infection should be 100%) and would not provide a useful predictor for variation in infection with other microbes. Are you only looking at non-obligate types to address this issue? 95-99: Not sure if you need to present all main results here. What would be useful is an explanation of the broader impacts of this study to describe the motivation behind what you did. Methods 108: By identifying ticks by sex you imply you only looked at adults. This should be stated along with an explanation as to why this life-stage only was investigated and not also nymphs which could also be infected with pathogens. 124: Should use &#8220;SFGR&#8221; acronym here? 124-25: Here and in further paragraphs you did not state this was real-time PCR (as was stated in the results). Please make that clear where appropriate throughout the methods section. 127-28: Need to give the primer sequences here? (also further in methods whenever a new primer is listed?) Otherwise please make clear these were taken directly from a previous publication. 153-55: Why were ticks screened for F. tularensis too? Would it not be detected in the next generation methods for some reason? There are also no methods for this given as was for the Rickettsia infection. 157-163: There was no mention of investigating host blood meal in the introduction when presenting the hypothesis so it is unclear why this step is being done. 202: Can you give further explanation of the Procrustes analysis? This is not as common an analysis as the others you describe. 197-216: This section is very list-y and there are a lot of different analyses done. In general, it would be helpful to explain why there are so many types of analyses being done and which relate to what parts of your hypothesis, otherwise it is hard to follow. Results 232: How many samples were removed by having too few sequences for rarefaction or other quality control reasons? Were sequences from the negative controls removed? How were these NCs accounted for in the analysis? 236: There is no description of the stats done to compare the bacterial communities between tick sexes. This is true of many of the non-QIIME or sequence-based analyses throughout the results section which will be noted below. 242: add &#8220;sequences&#8221; or &#8220;reads&#8221; (whichever is most appropriate&#8221; to end of this sentence. 244-47: This seems surprising as Fransicella is the obligate symbiont of most Dermacentor and would be expected to make up the highest proportion of sequences. Is your result that Rickettsia was higher surprising, especially given the PCR results showed low prevalence? 249-50: There was no explanation of the Faith&#8217;s PD in the methods. Why was this used instead of a more common metric like Shannon Index? Figure 2: there is no y-axis label on either 2A or 2B. Figure 4: The stars seem very awkwardly placed. Are you able to use whatever program you used to make the plot insert symbols for significance? 250-51: By &#8220;amount&#8221; do you mean number of rarefied sequences? It is important to make this distinction since you did not measure absolute amounts of bacteria, but you are using number of sequences as a proxy. 254: Again, there is no explanation of the ANOSIM analysis in the methods (i.e. what predictors were used, what the test stat means, etc). 255: Can you give an explanation of why location is an important factor in the analysis? It is known that SFGR infections are patchy in distribution or based on host community composition, for example? This should also go in the introduction. 258-61: Is there a reason why the rarer taxa in the community would be more useful to analyze between locations? 261-64: Again, could you provide more context or explanation for how to interpret the results of the Procrustes analysis since it is not commonly used? 164-69: There was no description of the Isolation by distance analysis in relation to the Mantel test in the methods. Please add explanation in the methods. Also, why was the unweighted UniFrac tree used here and not weighted, since you described both were constructed. 270-71: Why are these specific genera referenced here in relation to differences in abundance between sites? They were not all listed as the most common genera. Was this analysis done for all genera? 276: This paragraph should be moved to near the beginning of the results to describe the community composition before going into further analyses. 278-82: If there was a 100% consensus sequence match why go into the other next closest matches? Are any of these of significance? Otherwise I would remove this. 298: Were the number of rarefied sequences used in the Pearson&#8217;s correlation? (there was no description of this analysis in the methods) Figure 4: This figure is impossible to read and get any useful information. It is especially difficult because the statistic associated with it was not explained. I would recommend changing to a scatterplot, if the rarefied sequence of Francisella and Rickettsia were used in the analysis, or a boxplot which has infection category (inf/not inf) with one pathogen as the x-axis and rarefied sequence number as the y-axis. Otherwise there is no way to glean a clear message from the figure or relate it to the analysis done on the data. 309: Add a comma between &#8220;Non-Rickettsia&#8221; and &#8220;non-Francisella&#8221;. 298-312: Can you pick either the Pearson&#8217;s correlation or the Random Forest analysis to test how infection with Francisella is associated with infection with Rickettsia? Are they redundant? It would streamline the results if only one of these was used since they seem to do very similar things. 315: What does &#8220;worked&#8221; mean in this context? 317: What data is not shown? If ticks were all collected by dragging they should be definition be host seeking. 317-319, Supplemental Table 2: This table is not very useful. What would be more helpful is a figure or table that illustrate what OTUs are shared between the ticks and the host bacterial communities. There is also no Methods explanation of why a t-test was used, with what data, etc. 321-23: Are these genera common to many microbiomes? If they are very common maybe finding them in both host and tick microbiomes isn&#8217;t too surprising, but if they are then this is useful information. Information on if any of these genera are also in the negative controls would help answer this question too. Discussion 346-48: Again, comparison of the sample and negative controls would help address this concern of contamination or importance of environmentally-derived taxa. 350-65: These seem like new results. They should go in the results section. Also, as they are written they are very hard to follow given all the sample and OTU numbers. How were the OTUs ranked? As currently stated they are hard to understand especially since there is little or no association between the numbers and the taxa in the results. Ranking by OTU abundance may be more intuitive so the numbers of the OTUs that are more often discussed have &#8220;easier&#8221; numbers (i.e. OTU1, OTU2, etc). Having a supplemental table of the OTUs and their associated consensus sequences should be included for reader reference. 367-71: These also seem like new results and should be moved to the Results section. 373-84: It would be helpful to include a figure similar to Figure 1 comparing the community composition between males and females in addition to the one you currently have on just differences in diversity. It would be expected that females would have a higher proportion of sequences from the endosymbionts due to these infecting the ovaries. 382-84: Can you give any other possible reason why males and females would differ? Would the dominance of endosymbiont in female samples reduce the number of sequences from other taxa, lowering the measure of richness/diversity in females compared to males? 386-400: Compartments? This is the first time this term has been used. This paragraph is overall well written and easy to follow, but it could use some references to support your interpretation of the results. 418-9: Sentence unclear.

The authors previously (2014) used XRD analysis to quantify calcite versus aragonite in primary skeletons of the same coral species studied in the present manuscript.  XRD has the advantage over Meigen&#8217;s stain of being unambiguous and quantitative.  Since the authors previously performed this analysis (and strengthened their 2014 paper with it), I&#8217;m curious as to why this analysis was not performed here.  It should be done in place of the Meigen&#8217;s stain.Line 127. DAVID requires a background gene set and there were recently no pre-built ones for corals.  Did the authors make their own?

Has this been tested? 1b has some slight stained spots form Meigen&#8217;s staining process, with major unstained regions. Has calcite to aragonite ratio been quantified in both the cases? Including this information would be useful.                 In this paper, authors are trying to understand the mechanisms involved in making calcite or aragonite in coral skeletons.Transcriptomics of Acropora tenuis in low Mg conditions showed differential expression of certain genes identified previously. Adding following information to the manuscript would be helpful.- A comparison of genes upregulated during calcite formation in shell formers with the current calcite coral data, along with genes upregulated during aragonite formation in aragonite coral vs the previous transcriptomes from Acropora and stylophora.

In this study, author mainly mined neuropeptides from public SRAs in seven decapods and analysed the similarities between decapod and insect neuropeptidomes. This is a meaningful work for bioinformaticians, and somehow could be attractive to the groups of people who are interested in neuropeptides. However, there are some problems should be noticed.1. In Results, the subheading was named &#8220;CCH/MIH&#8221; (see line 252), but in Discussion, the subheading was named &#8220;CHH and MIH&#8221; (see line 501). It will make the readers troubled. If you insist &#8220;CCH&#8221;, this abbreviation should be explained, otherwise, it will make the other puzzle with &#8220;CCHamide&#8221;.

In insects, ion transport peptide (ITP) belongs to CHH-family peptides. In Figure 1, this feature have been shown, however, the ITP were unmentioned in mainly text.4. In this study, two Scylla (Scylla paramamosain and Scylla olivacea) were mentioned. But the single word &#8220;Scylla&#8221; often appears in the main text, figures and tables.

On the other hand, the neuropeptidome of Scylla olivacea was entitle &#8220;Prediction of Scylla olivacea (Crustacea; Brachyura) peptide hormones using publicly accessible transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) sequences&#8221; should be noticed.5.

The case study is the Missouri River (USA), along which the authors selected three river and weather stations. The results show that the machine learning models outperform the statistical models, in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Correlation (R), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSC).The manuscript is generally well organized and structured and it is well written. The authors should possibly improve the clarity of some paragraphs in section 2.3 where the machine learning procedures are described, in order to make them clearer also to readers that have no or little familiarity with this type of models.While several fundamental works are acknowledged in the bibliography, I believe that others are missing and should be mentioned in the Introduction section. I provide a list of works that in my opinion are missing in the Comments for the author below. In general, I suggest reviewing the structure of the Introduction section as in its current form the logical flow could be improved in some parts (see Comments for the author below). The authors provided the raw data used for the analysis, but they should also explicitly indicate the website where the data have been retrieved (see also my comments in Experimental design below). According to the Journal&#8217;s policy, I also believe that the scripts used for the modelling could be made available, possibly with a brief description of their usage.Figures are esplicative, but I suggest modifying Fig 2 showing all stations. In fact, the air temperature series (i.e., the forcing of all models) is shown only in this figure, thus this information is not available for stations 1 and 2 (only station 3 is shown in Fig 2). In doing so, please improve the readability of the two series of data by reducing the dimension of the symbols or using a line. Possibly, showing also streamflow could be useful to better discuss the results, and in particular the low performance at station 1 (where I believe that streamflow plays a key role, see also my comments below). I suggest indicating the date instead of sample number in all figures with time series of water temperature.  Probably Fig 1 could be simplified making it larger and indicating north, scale, and location of the stations directly in the left panel. Please, check the aspect ratio of the figure.                 The research questions are well defined and are within the scope of the Journal.The description of the methods could be improved in section 2.3, in order to make the paper clearer and accessible also to people which are not experts of machine learning techniques.I ask the authors to revise the mode inter-comparison. The correct way to estimate the relative performance of the different models would be to use an information criterion, in order to properly account for the trade-off between the goodness of the results and the simplicity of the model (number of parameters). The authors should identify a fair criterion to be used when comparing machine learning and regression models, or otherwise comment on why this was not possible. If it is possible to univocally define the number of parameters in the proposed machine learning methods, an information criterion as e.g., BIC or AIC could be easily introduced in the analysis.Please, consider also that given the strong seasonality river water temperature it would be better using a modified definition of the NSC, according to Schaefli and Gupta (2007). See also Piccolroaz et al., 2016, both for the use of this index and model inter-comparison based on an information criterion (AIC in that case).Among the simple models to predict river water temperature based on air temperature, there is a third category of models characterized by a hybrid formulation that combines a physical derivation of the key equation with a stochastic calibration of parameters (Toffolon and Piccolroaz, 2015 air2stream model freely available at https://github.com/spiccolroaz/air2stream). I believe that the overall analysis would benefit if the authors could include also this type of models in their analysis as a model grounded on physical principles is missing. This is just a suggestion and not a request. I have no doubts that, if the authors decide to include it, they will be able to easily and competently add this model to the analysis (e.g., the 5-parameter version, which depends only on air temperature).                 The time series of the three stations used by the authors have different duration. In particular, stations 1 and 2 have a much shorter time series for calibration and station 2 has an incomplete year for model validation. Model performance is certainly affected by the duration of the series used for calibration, making the comparison among the different stations unfair. I was wondering whether other data are available. Looking at the USGS website (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/), which is from where I believe the authors downloaded the data, I found that other stations are available along the Missouri River, some of those with much longer time series. I ask the authors to verify if other data are available for the stations that they used, and/or to add other stations with longer/comparable time series. At this link all stations in the Missouri region with available data are listed: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv?referred_module=sw&amp;huc2_cd=10&amp;site_tp_cd=ST&amp;index_pmcode_00010=1&amp;index_pmcode_00011=1&amp;group_key=NONE&amp;sitefile_output_format=html_table&amp;column_name=agency_cd&amp;column_name=site_no&amp;column_name=station_nm&amp;column_name=site_tp_cd&amp;column_name=lat_va&amp;range_selection=date_range&amp;begin_date=2000-03-07&amp;end_date=2018-03-06&amp;format=gif&amp;date_format=YYYY-MM-DD&amp;rdb_compression=file&amp;list_of_search_criteria=huc2_cd%2Csite_tp_cd%2Crealtime_parameter_selection (it takes some minutes to load the whole list).I could not find water temperature for stations 1 and 3 in the USGS website, and station 2 covers a different period compared to that used by the authors. Please, make clear the source of data used in the analysis. In addition, station 1 is not along the main course of the Missouri River, but along a small tributary (Apple Creek). This explains the significantly different annual cycle of water temperature, and also the worse model performance. In fact, I believe that the shape of the temperature cycle of this river is likely affected by streamflow, a variable that is not included in the models used by the authors but that can significantly affect water temperature in many rivers (Isaak et al., 2010; van Vliet et al., 2011; Arismendi et al., 2014; Toffolon and Piccolroaz , 2015; Sohrabi et al., 2017). This should be explicitly commented in the discussion of the results. In this respect, adding also streamflow to Fig 2 could be useful. The results part should be expanded commenting on why in some stations the models behave better than in others, why some models behaves better than others, what are the limitations of the models considered in the analysis (e.g., the effect of discharge). Notice also that the Missouri River is acknowledged for ice formation and floating, how this can affect the model predictions? It is also known that river water temperature is chiefly modulated by the hydrological regime of the river (Webb and Nobilis, 2007; Kelleher et al.2012; Lisi et al., 2015; Piccolroaz et al., 2016). What are the hydrological regimes of the Missouri River and of the Apple Creek? Can the authors prove or speculate the portability of the proposed models to rivers with other hydrological regimes? In this sense, considering the main course of the Missouri River and also some tributaries (e.g., the Apple Creek) could be of interest. Can the author comment of the possible extension of this type of model to regulated rivers (e.g., dammed rivers)?In conclusion, I find the analysis proposed by the authors promising and potentially a valuable contribution in the field of water temperature modelling in rivers, but I ask to carefully consider the above comments before possible publication on this Journal.             Comments:Abstract: choose better wording than &#8220;creating&#8221; and &#8220;constructed&#8221;Line 76: I would say that these are factor affecting river water temperature and not the &#8220;prediction&#8221; of river water temperature. Among these factors, acknowledge also anthropogenic impacts (Hester and Doyle, 2011) and the hydrological regime (Webb and Nobilis, 2007; Kelleher et al.2012; Lisi et al., 2015; Piccolroaz et al., 2016).Line 81: remove &#8220;quite&#8221;Line 84: add references, as e.g., Stefan and Preud'homme, 1993; Mohseni and Stefan, 1999; Caissie, 2006.  Please, acknowledge also the limitations of using only air temperature, discharge may also play a crucial role (e.g., among others van Vliet et al., 2011; Arismendi et al., 2014; Toffolon and Piccolroaz , 2015).Line 85: go to new lineLine 97-101: please, acknowledge also hybrid statistical-physical based models as air2water (Toffolon and Piccolroaz, 2015; Piccolroaz et al., 2016).Line 116-119: it actually depends on the hydrological regime.Line 119-122: see also (Stefan and Preud&#8217;homme (1993), Isaak et al. (2012), Toffolon and Piccolroaz (2015) for a discussion on the thermal inertia (depending on the hydrological regime of the river).Line 124-125: please, reformulate.Line 126-127: the annual component is the long-term component. What is missing here is the fluctuating short-term component. This is also discussed in Cassie, 2006. Lines 131-132: please expand this sentence otherwise the 5th point is not very informative.Line 133: what do the authors mean with &#8220;suitable lags&#8221;?Line 138-140: people may do not know what are MLP, RBF, ANN, and GPR models. Probably this paragraph should start with an introductory sentence on machine learning models.Line 149-151: the prediction of river flow is not the subject of the paper, so I would remove this sentence.Line 133-161: this is a long paragraph that should be revised (see also the previous comments). The first sentence introduces the question of selecting appropriate model inputs (predictor variables) and lags (not sure what do the authors mean), but then this question is not answered in the coming sentences, where the focus shifts on model inter-comparison. Section 2: please, provide information about the hydrological regime of the river, location of the stations (main course, tributaries). See also my previous comment about the use of additional stations. Add also all the necessary details about who provided the data and how they can be accessed.Lines 196-197: &#8230; a non linear regression models and a stochastic regression modelSection 2.3: Do I correctly understand that the authors used t, Ta(t), Ta(t-1) and Ta(t-2) as predictors? At line 230, Tw(t) should be water temperature not air temperature. I ask the authors to make the description of the machine learning models simpler to make it clearer for readers not familiar with this kind of models. A schematic of the three models could be helpful.Equation 9: please, consider the use of the modified NSC, according to Schaefli and Gupta (2007)Line 319-321: probably referring to calibration and validation periods would be better than &#8220;training dataset&#8221; and &#8220;test dataset&#8221;.Table 3: do these values refer to the training (calibration) or test (validation) period? From the caption of the table I understand that they refer to the testing (validation) period. Is this correct? I would probably show all performance metrics for both periods. Line 375: the possibility to easily include additional input variables is an important statement. Probably this goes beyond the scope of the current analysis, but an interesting extension of the study could be adding also streamflow in input and compare the three machine learning models with other models that use both air temperature and streamflow (Toffolon and Piccolroaz , 2015; Sohrabi et al., 2017). This could be commented in the conclusions or at the end of the results section.Lines 378-380 are a repetition of lines 263-265Section 3: I feel like in this section a detailed discussion of results is missing. I would rename the section as Results and Discussion and add some detailed comments on the results.

I think the figures are ok, but styles differ throughout (figure 2 looks like a excel screenshot) and it isn't clear why only certain models are included in the evaluation figures 4-6. We only see timeseries for two of the three ML models and none of the traditional models. A number of citations were dated but referred to as \"recent work\" (see more below). The examples for ecosystem value of river temperature data was limited and I think the authors shouldn't have their first example be a coral reef since this paper is about river temperatures. I don't see the source of the data cited. USGS data should be cited as \"U.S. Geological Survey, 2018, National Water Information System&#8212;Web interface, accessed {date}, at http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN.&amp;quot;                 The research design is adequately described and we have enough details to reproduce it. I do not think the authors went far enough to make this compelling. Their study area was a rare situation were they have good historical USGS temperature data and did not evaluate two things that would make these results more useful to the discipline: 1) impact of missing/sparce training data (the authors have a lot of training data, as opposed to evaluating the various models when 50% are removed, or more). 2) the ability to use one station's temperature data as input into another station model. Temperature stations could be leveraged in the modeling approach since temperature is the most widely measured aquatic measurement. What is the impact of including up/downstream measurements in various model formulations. I think the authors either need to show their results (the ranking of models) are appropriate elsewhere in the very different climate/flow regime, or add more depth to their study (such as the two suggestions above).                 The findings seem valid but it is challenging to understand how transferable the results are. It isn't clear why the authors only use three sites and if the results could be applied elsewhere. We also could benefit from seeing/discussing limitations of the various approaches, such as seasonal biases or prediction failures. It is also odd to have the test dataset for station 2 to use an incomplete year. This makes it so we can't evaluate later season predictions. Please change than and use a full season for test. It isn't clear why figures 4-6 only represent two ML models, and do not (in one case, figure 5) show the model w/ the best performance (ANN in the case of station 2).             Comments:line 67: don't use a coral reef fish temperature example in a paragraph about river temperature. Use a river temperature example (there are many)lines 62-72: also should mention the relationship between gasses and temperature solubility, which impacts ecosystem health. Also, temperature-dependent metabolism. line 73: why is it a complex issue \"to accurately predict water temperature\"? tell us why or provide a citation. These things are all measureable, doesn't that make it easier?

In brief summary, this manuscript is worthy to be published after minor revisions. It clarified an important issue (i.e. taxon delimitation of the youngest ichthyosaurs) and, on this basis, update the analysis of their diversity (both taxonomic and ecological). The article could be of interest not only to ichthyosaur specialist but to researchers working on marine vertebrates. Ichthyosaurs, sensu lato, are an iconic group of tetrapods secondary adapted marine life. The extinction of the group (not related to a catastrophic event) is still debated. Trying to understand this issue needs, necessary, a robust alpha-taxonomic basis. That is, a consensus as robust as possible on low level (= species level) taxon delimitation. My mayor concern is related with type-designation criteria. I think that criteria established by the ICZN (Articles 72.1.1, 72.2 9 and 73) are not completely satisfied. The author designates the CAMSM B20659 as holotype of Pervushovisaurus campylodon nov.comb. (chosen among assumed Carter&#180;s syntype series) . I am not convinced that this is correct as Fischer (present contribution) is not an original designation so this specimen must not be considered as holotype.  Even if we accept that the series CAMSM B20644 - CAMSM B20659 collectively constitute the name-bearing type (=syntype series) of Ichthyosaurus campylodon Carter 1846, the CAMSM B20659 can be designated as lectotype. In any case, I don&#180;t think that the CAMSM B20659 can be designated as holotype as Fischer (present contribution) is not the original author of Ichthyosaurus campylodon = Platypterygius campylodon = Pervushovisaurus campylodon. (see comments on the pdf file). Minor comments on figures: as the taxomic history of names is a central issue of this contribution (particularly Carter&#180;s type serie) maybe a figure of original labels (or photos of the material that permit to see these details) could help to follow the authors arguments exposed on &#8220;State of the art&#8221; section.Finally, as I am not a native speaker, I don&#180;t know if the English is unambiguous and/or if the English grammar and sentence structure are correct.                                                                    ", "I have made several minor corrections and comments throughout the text, in the attached PDF but otherwise the basic reporting appears good.                 The primary aim of this paper is to clarify the history, morphology and taxonomy of 'Platypterygius' campylodon, a long-standing but relatively poorly studied Cretaceous ichthyosaur. This is a useful endeavor and the author has made valuable contributions by apparently relocating the original syntype series, and providing good figures and detailed comparisons with related species, as well as a detailed account of the confusing taxonomic history. The paper also includes a cluster analysis of ecological guild structure of Cretaceous ichthyosaurs based on skull and tooth morphology. I find this part of the study somewhat out of place here for two reasons. 1) It appears at that 'P.' campylodon is not included in this analysis - despite being the focus of this paper. 2) This analysis essentially replicates a very recent publication by the author (Fischer et al. 2016, Nature Communications), with minor corrections and additions to the underlying dataset resulting in the movement of two taxa from the 'apex predator' to the 'generalist guild.'  While I understand the desire to published a corrected analysis - it seems insufficiently integrated into the main aim of this paper. I would recommend dropping the guild analysis entirely unless it can be more clearly linked to the reanalysis of P. campylodon - and/or the novel results relative to the very recently published version can be better highlighted, again ideally within the context of the primary goals of the study.                 Overall, I find the basic findings of the paper to be well reasoned and well supported. This work fits nicely in the arc of Dr. Fischer's work over recent years to clarify the relationships, morphology and evolution of Cretaceous ichthyosaurs. I do have a handful of questions and concerns, which are detailed in notes in the attached PDF but I will summarize here:1) The author selects a 'holotype' from among the original type series. I believe this should more accurately be called and considered a 'lectotype' as it is (apparently) derived from the original syntype series described by Carter. If it is the case that this *specific specimen* from among those figured and described by Carter was intended as the holotype, that needs to be explained more clearly. Also, in that case, the 'syntypes' described here would actually become paratypes. Please review the nomenclature used in the paper and ensure that it is accurate and adheres to ICZN guidelines.2) The author makes a pretty strong case for using the historically well-established genus 'Myopterygius' as a replacement for 'Platypterygius' for P. campylodon. He states:(lines 375-377) \"Resurrecting Myopterygius for reception of Ichthyosaurs campylodon would thus match the original interpretation of Huene, in a binomial that is still largely found in several museum collections across Europe.\"and(lines 384-386) \"...Ichthyosaurus campylodon better represents the original intention of Huene and matches recommendations 69A.7, 69A.8, 69A.9, 69A.10 of the ICZN code, because I. marathonensis was poorly known when Huene published his work.\"However, instead the author decides to transfer Myopterygius to 'P. australis' apparently on the grounds that that taxon is represented by abundant, well preserved and more complete material. Further justification for this transfer is given: \"because Fischer et al. (2016) found that &#8216;Platypterygius&#8217; australis is distantly related to Platypterygius platydactylus\" however those results are not explicitly reproduced, or recounted here. Fischer et al. 2016 instead stated: \"It is still premature to make a taxonomic decision on Platypterygius.\" It is difficult to see what major findings presented here would have changed this.While I think technically legal, and not unreasonable, I believe the transfer of 'P.' australis to Myopterygius here is somewhat inadvisable as it has sweeping taxonomic implications for a well studied taxon that is not the focus of this work. The taxonomic history of P. australis is already complicated, and while transferring it to a new (or in this case, old) genus could be justified, I think that would be better achieved as part of a study that more comprehensively detailed the morphology and relationships of the species, or, even better, a detailed treatment of Platypterygius as a whole, building on the results of Fischer et al. 2016 and others. It might be that one motivation for the resurrection of Myopterygius is to get the name 'out of the way' so that P. campylodon could be transferred to Perushovisaurus. However this does not seem absolutely necessary to me. I think P. campylodon could be referred to Perushovisaurus on the grounds given in this study (although see concerns about ontogenetic polarity of some characters in comments on pdf) without taking up the status of Myopterygius or 'P.' australis for the time being. That would be the approach I recommend here I think. 3) The final section of the paper speculates about the function of the overbite observed in P. campylodon, relative to more extensive (in some cases MUCH so) overbites in other ichthyosaur species, and other aquatic taxa. The overbite shown here seems quite modest (indeed it might be exaggerated on figure 1 -- see note), and possibly also related to allometric growth as it is weakly developed on smaller specimens. In this case I wonder whether it really invites specific functional considerations, certainly any kind of specialized sensory function seems pretty weakly indicated by morphology.             Comments:See comments on attached PDF. I think this is sound work that should certainly be published, I hope that my comments and suggestions are of use.                                                                    "], "10.7717/peerj.7406": ["I feel the manuscript lacks a bit of general introduction or discussion about the current knowledge on the roles and evolution of kinases in the plant kingdom. In particular, the evolutionary conservation of protein kinases in eukaryotes is not mentioned at all. For example, a quick search in PFAM database retrieved more than 600 Symbiodinium protein sequences with a potential kinase activity. Also, protein kinases are well described in multicellular plants (for example Arabidopsis thaliana has &gt;1000 genes encoding kinases, see Wang et al., &#8220;The Protein Phosphatases and Protein Kinases of Arabidopsis thaliana&#8221;, Arabidopsis book, 2007).I also found some typos in the manuscript:- line 60 &#8220;&#8230; genus Symbiodinium, are photosynthetic&#8230;\" I would remove the coma; - idem line 62 &#8220;In both, their&#8230;&#8221;; line 234: &#8220;(gives)&#8221;; - lines 302-303, I did not understand the following sentence &#8220;Unfortunately, because anti-pTyr antibody-cross reactive proteins were inconsistently observed and due to the lack of reproducibility, were not considered.\"                 Major technical concern: No loading controls are provided in the figures. I strongly encourage the authors to provide images of nitrocellulose membranes stained with a general protein staining such as coomassie blue to show that equal amounts of proteins are present in the lanes analyzed by western blot. This is of particular importance for the experiments where modulation of the phosphorylations is induced experimentally. The presence of such loading controls would greatly improve the reader&#8217;s level of confidence in the experiments.Minor technical concern: the authors are using a NBT/BCIP revelation technique for the revelation step of the western blots. This technique is based on the activity of an alkaline phosphatase and I am questioning the effect of this phosphatase on nitrocellulose immobilized phosphorylated proteins.                 In this study, Castillo-Medina and colleagues have used an interesting approach to reveal the presence of serine-, threonine- and proline-phosphorylated proteins in extracts from different Symbiodinium species subjected to various experimental conditions. A strong limitation of the technique lies in the fact that there is no possibility to directly identify the phosphorylated proteins or the kinases responsible of the phosphorylation. Nevertheless, this work allowed the authors to reveal the presence of Ser, Tyr and Thr phosphorylation in their Symbiodinium samples. They also revealed phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events in response to light stimuli. Despite the aforementioned limitations, this piece of work is interesting per se, especilly if we consider the very little amount of data already published in the field.             Comments:To my sense, this work meets Peer J standards and should be published after completion of the minor revisions listed herein.                                                ", "The authors Castilla-Medina et al. have presented a profile of phosphorylated proteins from three species of the Symbiodinium family and specifically the light induced phosphorylation and rephosphorylation switch of a 75 kDa proteins from S. microadriaticum. The study is essential as it aimed at filling the knowledge gap about the key signal transduction proteins that undergo the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation switch in response to environmental stimuli like light conditions, nutrient content and availability, etc. The manuscript is easy to understand with clear English language and proper use of grammar and is structured as per PeerJ standards. The authors have reviewed relevant and adequate background information to set a context to the research question being addressed. The reviewer thanks the authors for providing the necessary raw data corroborating their results.                 Though the authors have well-defined the research question and provided relevant data to corroborate their findings, the results are preliminary and require further corroboration with orthologous methods. The reviewer has following concerns about the data reported and suggestions to further improve the manuscript &#8211; 1.\tThe authors have stated the detailed protocol for cell lysate preparation and isolation of supernatant for protein analysis, however, protease and phosphatase inhibitors were not used during lysate preparation. It is critical to use a concoction of these inhibitors, especially, phosphatase inhibitors as Espina, V. et al (Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics, 7(10), 1998-2018) reported an augmentation of phosphorylation after phosphatase inhibitor use.2.\tThe study uses polyclonal anti-pThr and anti-pSer antibodies whereas monoclonal anti-pTyr. The authors should provide an explanation for the same. 3.\tThe western blot procedure uses PBST, however, phosphates in the PBST buffer can potentially interfere and therefore it is recommended to use TBST instead of PBST4.\tThe authors should consider presenting the total protein content of the lysate as control. 5.\tThe intensity of the bands indicated for phosphorylated proteins in figure 1 are very weak and barely visible. Perhaps, the authors can try lower dilutions of the primary and/or secondary antibodies, longer incubations times or temperature etc. to increase the intensity of the bands. However, if the authors have already tried different ways to improve the band intensity, they should mention in the results section. 6.\tTo further support their western blot findings about the effect of light on dephosphorylation &amp; rephosphorylation of pp75 protein in S. KB8, the authors should consider estimating the band intensities in figures 2 and 3 using densitometry analysis on three separate assays to estimate the statistical significance of this phenomenon.7.\tThough the western blot is partially convincing, the authors should definitely consider using orthologous methods like mass spectrometry to corroborate their findings. Mass spectrometry is highly sensitive and is considered a gold standard method for studying phosphorylated proteins and other post-translational modifications (Mann, M. et al. (2002) Trends Biotechnol. 20:261).                 The above-mentioned suggestions will strengthen the manuscript and will serve to fill a critical knowledge gap as mentioned by the authors. Though the findings are interesting, the work is still preliminary and needs further improvement before it can be accepted for publication. The reviewer strongly advocates use of orthologous method to corroborate the findings as, in general, there are some concerns with the specificity and cross-reactivity of phospho-antibodies.

", "The results presented were very limited and immature for publishing.Please also see my comments below.                 This manuscript falls within the scope of PeerJ, but the research question was vaguely defined. The hypothesis, approaches, and results were not justified.The authors identified the gap as &#8216;&#8230;very little information from the genus Symbiodinium regarding proteins that participate in key phosphorylation processes for signal-transduction events that arise from environmental stimuli&#8217;. They sought to identify phosphorylated proteins, but showed only western blots, without actually identifying anything.Why didn&#8217;t the author use the mass spec to identify the proteins? The author should at least report which genes/proteins are the phosphorylated proteins. Otherwise, this piece of research will not benefit anyone in the field or those who are interested in Symbiodinium biology. The genome of Symbiodinium kawagutii was assembled and annotated in 2015 (Lin S. et al, Science). The authors should try to identify the protein of interest using this data. Are there homologous proteins to other known light-induced signaling proteins?

If that is the case, then this process is not related to phosphorylation at all.None of the results were validated by other methods. I am not convinced.

In the first sentence of the abstract it is unclear what the range 35-89% refers to (I assumed countries, but it turned out to be prior studies). Perhaps the number of studies considering survival after RT has been limited, but part of the reason may be that this is information that cancer registries collect (at least in the US). If I wanted to know five-year HNC survival after RT, I would not consult the literature; I would consult the SEER database, where I would get a definitive number that was population-based. If Taiwan lacks a cancer surveillance system where it is easy to find this information, then this paper serves a useful purpose in that regard.                 The authors have identified significant independent effects of region and income on HNC survival in Taiwan, as well as effects related to treatment type. The data are robust and the statistical methods valid. The magnitude of the effects is rather large and would seem to lend itself to some potential intervention.The authors suggest that the male-female differences may be related to betel nut use, but they do not say whether betel nut use varies by region or income level - it would seem to.In the concluding paragraph, it would be useful not to simply restate the findings, but to address what, if anything, could or should be done to reduce the large disparities that were identified.             Comments:There is a strong effect of receiving chemotherapy having a higher mortality rate. This is counterintuitive as chemotherapy is supposed to be beneficial.

Patients with low income levels had a 51.4% greater risk of mortality than patients with high income levels (HR = 1.514, p &lt; 0.001). or whether it is \"median survival\" (e.g. lines 145 -- in which case the difference in survival should be reported in months or days, not %).Similarly, this part is also confusing:172 Males had a 104.9% greater risk of mortality than females (HR = 2.049, 95% CI173 =1.943&#8211;2.162, p &lt; 0.001).It is not clear whether it was 5-year mortality or not.

I do not think stratifying by 2009 date of treatment will take care of that noise if it was not a complete replacement by VMAT after 2009. There is an important confounding in that case.9.\tyou need to elaborate your limitations &#8211; there are several other limitations and assumptions as mentioned above in  my comments, and they should be acknowledged here &#8211; they can significantly affect the results and their interpretations10.\tif you do not have data on HPV, at least talk about it in Discussion or limitations , as HPV is becoming a significant risk factor for HNC especially oro-pharyngeal cancers and HPV positive tumors are directly related to prognosis- they have better survival             Comments:1.\tOVERALL- there is a lot of scope to improve language all over the paper- regarding selection of words and connectors.

It&#8217;s mistakenly to compute significance by such a way. If we take a random data set and apply the cluster analysis, it will always break the set of objects into some groups. If we apply discriminant analysis namely to these groups using the same traits, DA will always show significant differences.A possible way out of this situation would be bootstrap analysis, but in general for cluster analysis these methods have not yet been developed.

Safonova and E. Cicinskas aims to describe the hemocyte populations from bivalves, Spisula sachalinensis and Callista brevisiphonata by a new method for identification.The manuscript is generally well-written and organized; however there are several general concerns, which, in my opinion, do not allow publishing it.                 1.\tIn Introduction the authors did not provide available information about types of hemocytes of the species studied. If there are no such data for these bivalves it should be stated. 2.\tThe analysis is carried out on 458 hemocytes of Spisula sachalinensis and 628 hemocytes of Callista brevisiphonata. Is this number of cells sufficient for statistics and further morphometric measurements? According to the Table 1 the SE for some cells characteristics is more than &#189; of the mean value (see the values of Area, Per, 1/2half, in50/out50, LCFD PreLac for Spisula sachalinensis and 1/2half for Callista brevisiphonata). Moreover, some of these parameters were used for the further characterization of hemocytes. This means, that determination of cell types, which are hardly distinguished due to their similarity and occurrence of transitional forms, is based on the parameters with great variability. May be authors should provide data confirming the significance of the differences in the characteristics chosen between types of hemocytes for each species.                 In Discussion the authors do not provide any comparative analysis of the results obtained by the new approach and other methods used for hemocyte identification. Thus, it remains unclear, whether the new technique gives the adequate precise distinguishing of hemocytes. There are no citations of literature within the section, therefore, the reader does not have an opportunity to independently come to conclusion about the efficacy of the method. The authors should provide information, which agrees with the data, obtained by the new method and confirms its convenience of application. References. The authors should substantially work with the literature. Among 12 citations only a half can be classified as &#8220;new&#8221; or &#8220;latest&#8221; works.

"], "10.7717/peerj.163": ["The manuscript by Steven Brady about local adaptation to relatively new habitat like roadside pools in amphibians is a nice example of the effects and consequences of landscape alteration of humans and the apparently incapacity of many organisms to adjust or adapt correctly to these new environments. In my opinion is a good contribution to conservation ecology from an evolutionary point of view. I will like but to suggest to the author to change the title, and remove the word \"fragmented landscape\". I agree with him, that roads (which is the main element analyzed in this manuscript as factor), contribute to landscape fragmentation, but from my point of view, the manuscript is not so much about \"strict\" fragmentation concept (reduction of habitat in small spots,etc.) but about new \"human created\" habitats. The forest pools where frogs are breeding are not reduced their areas, and the authors considered that gene flow among ponds is not affected by roads and traffic. The main factor is that pools closer to roads showed a different chemistry composition that those apart from the roads. I think that maladaptation is a consequence of contamination or alteration of habitats but not of landscape fragmentation.                 Field transplant experiments are nicely complemented with laboratory experiment where different factors like salt concentration can be isolated to test the effects of the main factor which could be involved on the adaptation or not of demes from different environments. The number of demes (10) distributed in five pair (roadside - forest), the number of clutches used from each environment and number of eggs and individuals used in each experiment, as the number of replicas give guarantees for the robustness of the results and acceptance or rejection of hypothesis.                 Statistical analyses are also rightly performed, using in all cases good statistical approaches to analyze the data obtained from the field and laboratory experiment. The control of effect by egg size, or mother size allow the author to control potential maternal effects which could difficult the interpretation of the results obtained.The figures are very compressible and help to readers to get a clear image of the results. I will only suggest to the author to change the scale of some figures, specially the one related with salt concentration treatments. Instead of using same distance between treatments I will like to use a lineal scale in the X-axis to better visualize the response of demes to different salt concentration treatment. Using a lineal scale it would be easier to see if mortality increase is lineal or there is some point of inflexion at which mortality increase in a exponential way.             Comments:I will suggest to the author to discuss a little bit about the differences in clutch size between roadside and forest demes. In the results it seems that it is a statistical difference between them, with females from roadside demes producing more eggs than forest demes: around 10% more eggs. Considering that mortality from these demes in higher: 15% in transplant experiments, it can be that the increase of egg deposition in these demes would be an adaptive response to \"compensate\" the higher embryos mortality. I think that this is an important point to be discussed in the discussion section, as a mechanisms that allow to roadside demes to survive and persist in those environments even in depress conditions for longer time before they completely disappear or adapt to the new conditions.

The author will make them available when accepted for publication.Figures and results for survival are summarizing means and SEs for the different origins/demes (roadside vs woodland). I would appreciate to see the results (and figures if it&#8217;s not too messy) broken down at the experimental pool level to see whether the lower performance of the roadside origin is consistent across pools.It is important to have more accurate information about the specific timing of egg collection in each deme and the stocking. Any potential differences in breeding time, especially between roadside and woodland pools, may have an impact on the results (implications explained in the &#8220;validity of the findings&#8221; section.The full results of the analyses of the abiotic variables should be presented MANOVA table and descriptive stats (at least in the supplementary file). No doubt the author only found differences in conductance, but it would be informative to see the rest as well. Without knowing the pool first hand, one would expect differences in vegetal cover/radiation and probably temperature between woodland and roadsides.Info about the specific R packages and procedures used to run the GLMMs would be appreciated.Many people may not be familiar with Bayesian inference and it would be good clarifying what the posterior mean refers to (eg. line 197) and the mean of what is being reported. Since the posterior mean is reported then is appropriate to give the associated 95% HPDI, not CIs, also explanation about how the Pmcmc is estimated would be helpful to grasp differences with frequentist p-values.

Assuming equal quality of the eggs of the two origins (woodland vs roadside) I don&#8217;t follow this reasoning.

Comments:This paper describes an interesting study that tested for local adaptation (woodland versus roadside ponds) by salamanders. The authors perform the usual local adaptation experiments through reciprocal transplants in nature and environmental manipulations (roadside salt) in the lab. They also estimate population sizes in the two environments in nature. Of particular interest, the authors find an unexpected pattern of maladaptation by the roadside salamanders &#8211; they show lower fitness under all conditions. This result appears quite strong and robust and is therefore very interesting and worth publishing.

You can&#8217;t leave the reader guessing for so long.2.\tLine 76: Wouldn&#8217;t unpaved roads also be salted?3.\tLine 80: But it would introduce a bias in the sense that eggs exposed to salt might be affected in such a way as to cause later reductions in survival even when transferred to non-salt. Thus, it is possible that this 36 hour differential exposure is the reason for the results &#8211; rather than local adaptation, differential migration, or maternal effects.4.\tLine 238: The dispersal would have to also be phenotype biased, which might not be clear based on the statement here. Also, the 36 hours of exposure before collection is another possibility.5.\tLine 240: I am not sure what is meant by &#8220;rarely reported.&#8221; Hereford et al. show many instances where performance is not higher in local environments. (I am also reminded of the Hendry and Gonzalez&#8217;s Biology and Philosophy debate about adaptation.) Maybe formally compare values from the current study to those in Hereford. For instance, how many studies in that meta-analysis fall into the category of one type performing better in both environments and, within that category, how strong is your result compared to the others?6.\tFor maternal effects to be the cause, the mothers that breed in roadside ponds would also have to have been born in those ponds, right? Or do maternal effects accrue during the short period a female sits in the pond before laying? In short, be more clear on just how the maternal effects are expected to work.7.\tLine 297-304: See Falk et al. (2012) in EER for a possible example.8.\tRoadside females are said to have higher fecundity than woodland females but inspection of the data (Figure 4) shows that this is true only for large females. When making this sort of test, a significant interaction (I can&#8217;t find information on whether it is or is not significant) means that one can&#8217;t make blanket statements about the difference in egg size &#8211; because it depends on female size.

Moreover, it is confusing later how this term is used.

If by deme, you mean reproductively isolated population, then you don&#8217;t know which are demes or not since you don&#8217;t have genetic data reported.

Background information on the study question and species is provided and for the most part the use of citations is appropriate, though there is a tendency for the citations to  be taxonomically narrow and in some cases more recent review articles are missing. A minor review of the introductory text and supporting literature would be useful. Finally, it appears that the raw data for the study are not present in the dataset. Instead, summary data at the individual level are provided. I think it may be more appropriate to provide all (n=25) sperm trait values for each male in addition to the summaries currently supplied.                 I have concerns regarding some of the methods used to assess sperm parameters and the low sample size. Moreover, I think some methodological details are lacking. For example, it is unclear how sperm were characterized as normal versus abnormal, nor how sperm were classified as progressively motile. Several other issues are also apparent, e.g. the use of absolute testis mass calculated as the average of the two testis, lack of control for allometry or other potentially confounding factors (e.g. mating strategy, age, etc). I have detailed these issues more fully below outlined as major comments or addressed by line number.                 I am not convinced the statistical analyses used are sufficient (e.g. lack of control for confounding variables) and it seems that many results are missing from the manuscript. Most importantly, given the limitations of the sample size and the lack of control for confounds, I think the authors need to be carefully cautious in their interpretation of the results. As it stands, I think the findings are given to much weight and the speculative components of the discussion are not sufficiently identified as such. With a major revision of the manuscript, in which the results are interpreted in light of the methodological and statistical shortcomings, this paper could be suitable for publication. However, it may be preferable to conduct some new analyses incorporating confounding variables (especially mating strategy, age, etc) to improve the quality of the work presented. I have detailed some issues related to the validity of the findings more fully below, outlined as major comments or addressed by line number.             Comments:In this manuscript, the authors examine the relationship among intra-male variation in sperm morphology and both testis size and sperm performance (swimming speed and progressive motility). The authors suggest their results show that males with larger testis mass produce populations of highly homogenous sperm (i.e. low CV in size), and that ejaculates with low variation in sperm size have higher sperm swimming speed and a greater proportion of morphologically normal sperm. Intraspecific studies, such as this one, can significantly contribute to our understanding of patterns and processes observed across populations and species. Thus, studies such as this one are valuable, and indeed I see value in this work being published. However, I have several major concerns about the methodologies used and the presentation and interpretation of the results that must be addressed before the work should be considered acceptable for publication.  Major comments:1.\tThe sample size of the current study is quite low (n=17), which suggests more caution is needed in the interpretation of the results. Moreover, there is no mention of potential confounding variables (e.g. male age, male reproductive status, mating strategy, inter-population variation, seasonal variation, etc) that may influence the variables investigated.2.\tI think the authors must reconsider the use of absolute testis size in their analysis. They argue that the do not control for allometry due to changes in male body condition over the course of the rut. Furthermore, they argue that species with alternate mating strategies (e.g. sneakers and harem-defenders), such as the red deer used in this study, show variation in relative testis investment. To me, this seems very problematic because male investment in testicular tissue can only be assessed in relative terms (otherwise bigger males will simply have larger testes) and because the mating tactic (i.e. sneaker v. harem-defender) of the males used in the study appears to be unknown. At the very least it is worth considering controlling for date or some other estimate of rut stage/progression and thus using relative testis size (by including both testis mass and body mass in a linear model). Similarly, it may be worth considering examining sneaker males and harem-defense males separately, or at least including this variable as a covariate in analyses. Otherwise, I don&#8217;t think you can rule out the possibility that the relationship between testis size and sperm size CV is in fact a spurious correlation generated by two clouds of data (one, perhaps sneaker males, with small testis and high sperm CV values and the other, harem-defenders, with big testis (resulting from pre-copulatory sexual selection on body size and allometry) and low sperm CV values) with no relationship between testis size and sperm CV within each of these mating strategies. Such a pattern may be evident in Figure 3C, for example, in which there seems to be a small break in testis mass between 35-35g. It would be helpful to know if the distribution of testis size is continuous or bimodal, though it is still preferable to account for body mass in analyses. Using log (mass) in analyses is also preferable. If the results did in fact show the data to be grouped by mating strategy this result would still be interesting, but this possibility strong influences the interpretation of the data. 3.\tRelated to the above point, I think the authors should use combined testes mass in the analysis. If they can calculate an average testis mass, then data is available for both left and right testis. Thus I see no reasons to use an average value as they have done. 4.\tI think the authors need to more fully explain the results of the current study and consider some of the variation in their findings in the discussion. For example, the relationship between testis mass and CV in sperm morphology mentions significant negative relationships between total sperm length, head width and area and trends for negative relationships with flagellum and midpiece length. However, no mention is made of the relationship between testis mass and the CV for sperm head length, either in the text or in tables. Similarly, the negative relationships between speed (i.e. VAP and VSL) and total sperm length, flagellum length and principal piece + terminal piece are outlined in the text, but there is no mention of if/how, for example, sperm midpiece or head length are related to sperm speed (I assume there is no relationship be the exclusion of these results??). I think this is an oversight. More importantly, the authors do not attempt to explain why some traits are correlated, while others are (presumed) uncorrelated (though this is hard to be certain of due to the lacking results). Given that the authors are trying to understand the functional significance of sperm variation (CV in size), I think this is also an oversight. I would like the authors to discuss (for example) why sperm speed might be related to variation in total sperm length, but not midpiece length. Similarly, why would the % of morphologically normal sperm be related to intramale CV in sperm head measures, but not any other measures of CV in sperm size? Thus I think the authors should considerably tighten and focus the manuscript, incorporating a significant rewrite of the methods (i.e. what relationships were examined), results and the discussion, which is currently rather broad and tends towards speculation and over interpretation. 5.\tLinked to the above comment, is that results that VAP and VSL are significantly related to some sperm traits, but VCL is not. First, this is not explained in the discussion. More importantly, these 3 variables are typically very strongly inter-correlated and thus I think the paper suffers from over inflation of multiple testing. I recommend the authors consider a PCA of the three measures to estimate a single PC that captures all the variation of these three variables. Alternatively, a single metric can be examined if it is closely linked with competitive fertilization success in this species. That being said, in my opinion, VCL is the best descriptor of sperm motion in these types of studies because it reflects the actual sperm path and not a simpler approximation of sperm motion. I think this is important under such in vitro conditions when sperm are not expected to swim in a straight line due to the lack of a chemo-attractant and potential wall effects of the chamber slide.  6.\tThe authors might consider some correction for multiple testing.7.\tI recommend the authors are considerably more cautious in the interpretation of the results given that sperm measures were assessed at variable time points post-mortem (4-8 hours) and that this was not included as a covariate in the analysis. Though the authors provide some evidence that this delay should not influence sperm parameters, the citation they provide did not assess the same sperm traits as are used in this study. Specifically, Soler and Garde (2003) examined the sperm motility index (made up of % motile and a motility quality score), while the current study examines velocity (e.g. VSL, VAP, VCL). Thus, while the data are potentially robust, I think the authors must be open to considering potential flaws in their methodology. A considerably modified discussion of the results is therefore warranted and would go a long way in making this work acceptable for publication. Minor comments:Line 57 &#8211; You could also include a citation for birds (Rowe and Pruett-Jones 2011) to expand the taxonomic focus of this statement. Similarly, it may be work considering the work of Garcia-Gonzalez and Simmons (2005) on sperm viability in insects at this point. Line 67-70 &#8211; I would consider including review papers that discuss the inconsistent relationship (at the interspecific level) between sperm morphology and swimming speed. For example, Fitzpatrick and Lupold 2014 (Molecular Human Reproduction) and Simmons and Fitzpatrick 2012 (Reproduction).Line 74-78 &#8211; This is relative testis size and not absolute testis size, which is a very important distinction. Please add &#8216;relative&#8217; to &#8216;testes size&#8217; in the text. Line 77-78 &#8211; it should be noted that there are also numerous studies showing a negative or no relationship between testis size and pre-copulatory traits. Inclusion of such studies would provide a more balanced introduction. Line 164-166 &#8211; What constitutes a normal versus abnormal sperm? Did you do any replicate measures (e.g. 2 x 100 sperm and then average the values? Where they repeatable?)Line 171 &#8211; How was progressive sperm motility defined? More details are necessary. For example, was it sperm at speeds over 50um/s?Line 173 &#8211; why was VCL &gt; 10 used as the cut-off for motile sperm?Line 193 &#8211; how is this low, please provide some comparison to judge whether or not these values are indeed low. For example, in birds a value of 4.56 would not be considered particularly low, but more moderate &#8211; medium. Line 225-226 &#8211; I think considerable the authors need to be more cautious in their statement that testicular mass is negatively related to sperm size variation for the reasons outlined above (lack of control for confounding variables, alternative mating tactics, lack of control for allometry and use of absolute testis mass, the use of an average testis mass and thus not a total estimate of male investment in testicular tissue). Line 234 &#8211; Actually it is relative testes mass that has been widely used as a proxy, not testis size. This may seem a trivial distinction, but in my opinion it is an important one. Line 246-249 &#8211; It seems to me that changes in the testicular architecture (specifically, the diameter of the seminiferous tubule lumen) is more likely to influence sperm morphology, and that such changes are more likely related to production of optimal sperm size. In contrast, there is more evidence for changes in spermatogenesis per se and testicular function impacting sperm numbers. The authors do raise the hypothesis of Mossman et al. (2013) at a later point in the discussion, which suggests that sertoli cell number may influence sperm size variability. However, this is still speculative. I think the discussion of these points needs to be considerably tightened and reduced in length. Line 261 &#8211; 264 &#8211; the discussion of apical hooks seems off topic and could be removed. Line 274 - The Mossman study was conducted on males undergoing treatment for infertility, thus these results need to be considered more cautiously, and I think this needs to be considered in the current manuscript also. Line 272 &#8211; 285 &#8211; But how does the finding that the CV of some sperm traits, but not others, are related to sperm VAP/VSL and % morphologically normal sperm influence this interpretation?Line 294- 298 &#8211; how might variation in sertoli call number be related to intra-male variation in sperm size? Moreover, if there is little variation in intramale sperm CV, is there really any potential for an association with sertoli cell number? This text is highly speculative and needs to provide more information on proposed nature of this relationship and the mechanisms underlying it.

The procedure employed for identifying fish as high responding or low responding are open to question.In this study blood samples were collected during a minor surgical procedure and the measurement of cortisol in these blood samples was been used to determine whether fish could be classified as high or low responding individuals. The procedure followed is that employed by the authors in a previous study (Raoult et al., 2012. Blood cortisol concentrations predict boldness in juvenile mulloway (Argyosomus japonicus). Journal of Ethology. 30, 225-232) although it is not clear whether these are the same fish as used in the previous study, or a separate population treated identically. (Please clarify)When comparing the magnitude of stress responses between individuals it is essential that the severity of the stressor, its duration, and the time of blood removal are as similar as possible for all individuals being compared. Here it has been assumed that the handling and disturbance associated with tag insertion constituted a standardised stressor.Blood samples were collected from fish at the same time as tag insertion occurred and the entire procedure is stated to have required less than 5 minutes from the initial disturbance. This time period of &lt; 5 mins is surprisingly short to have been used to compare stress responses among fish. When comparing the magnitude of stress responses it is normal practice to allow the response to develop fully, to maximise the levels of cortisol achieved in the blood and for this reason blood collection would normally occur within 30-60 mins after the onset of exposure to the stressor. For most if not all species of fish so far studied the rate of increase of cortisol in the blood is not sufficiently fast that a meaningful response would be evident within 5 minutes of initial disturbance. However, inspection of Fig. 1 shows the full range of blood cortisol concentrations, measured in mulloway during the tag insertion procedure, which extend from approx. 10 ng/ml to 600 ng/ml. Seemingly, some individuals responded to the procedure, which lasted less than 5 minutes, with virtually no change in cortisol concentration while some increased cortisol levels to several hundred ng/ml. The rapidity of the response implied by the larger concentrations is very different to the rates of change seen in commonly studied taxa.There appear to be only two previous publications that have examined cortisol levels in mulloway. The previous paper from the present authors, seemingly describing work done with the same population of fish (Raoult et al 2012), and an earlier paper describing effects of capture by angling methods (Broadhurst and Barker, 2000. Archive of Fishery and Marine Research 48, 1-10). The authors of the present paper make no reference to their cortisol data with respect to either of these. It would have been prudent to fully characterise the time-course of the stress response of mulloway before employing blood cortisol levels as a marker for personality type. Given the paucity of information on cortisol levels in this species, and the nature of its stress response, the authors should comment on their cortisol data, preferably with reference to the two preceding papers. 12. Line 86. An additional confounding factor is the inclusion of anaesthesia in the procedure &#8211; the effects of anaesthesia/sedation on the stress response in fish are not well understood. It may impair the stress response, or delay it. Certainly, it is a variable that should not have been deliberately incorporated into a stress-testing protocol. The sedation issue is further compounded because the authors employed a commercially available sedative AQUI-S which contains a clove oil derivative (isoeugenol). Isoeugenol reportedly reduces cortisol concentrations in fish during sedation (Small, B., 2004.  Effect of isoeugenol sedation on plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate dynamics in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus exposed to three stressors. Aquaculture 238, 469 &#8211; 481). It is surprising that a protocol designed to assess differences in individual stress responsiveness within a population of fish first exposed them to a substance known to interfere with the development of that response. Do the authors have any concerns that their results were in any way affected by the use of this sedative? A reader with any knowledge of AQUI-S will query this aspect of the study so it should be addressed.13. Line 131. The fish were tested as groups of either low-responding or high-responding individuals. Is it possible that the behavioural characteristics of the fish led to interactions within each group that influenced the outcomes? That is, produced an outcome different to that which would have been seen had the fish been tested individually?14. Results. Figure legends are currently a single sentence. They need to be more informative and not require the reader to refer to the main text to understand the content of the figures.15. Discussion. This was on the whole well-written and informative.                                                ", "This article adds to the growing literature of stress coping styles in fish. Although not completely novel, it helps to understand how stress relates to behavioural outputs involving cognition. The writting is overall clear with a professional English level. The references give an adequate background, although I suggest to clarify the differences between cognition and learning and to be consistent thorough the manuscript, since cognition or learning are not mentioned after the introduction, and the results and discussion are explained mainly on the light of fishes preference for either side of the experimental aquarium, not by the cognitive procesess involving such preferences. On line with this, I suggest to reconsider the title too. The main structure conforms to PeerJ standards. The figures and tables are sufficient and relevant; however, legends should be more self-explanatory, I suggest that you improve the description ej. table one could read: Summary of generalized linear model of recordings of the preference of mulloway for each compartment per day. I did not find evidence of raw data.                 The research is on line woth the aims and scope of PeerJ, and it was carried out following the local ethical standards. The question is well defined and the methodology well define. However, it is somewhat difficult to understand the experimental setting hence, I suggest you improve the experimental tank schematic representation. Also, clarify why you decided to stop recording the movements at 2000 readings, if your main results are based on differences over time. It would be good to have statistical information that such decision does not change the story. Also, cortisol values and ranges for high and low stress fish will give information to understand that both groups were completely different.                 I wonder why you did not measured cortisol at the end of the experiment to make sure that the differences between groups remained, since cortisol measurements are only a snapshot of the stress reponse, for one specific pont at the time. Also, it will be interesting to know if the individual weights before and after the test changed. I is known that growth rates vary with coping style (Biro et al, J Anim Ecol. 2006 Sep;75(5):1165-71) and that at least in groups of rainbow trout with the same coping styles it is due to a waste in food since low stress responders tend to waste more food, since they usually engage in aggressive behaviour (Overli et al, Aquaculture. Volume 261, Issue 2, 24 November 2006, Pages 776&#8211;781), do you think (or even have evidence for) that the same holds for a schooling fish as the molloway?Clarify, at least in the discussion why not to evaluate this in groups of mixed physiological phenotypes as it will be more representative of what is happening in the wild. I did not see a discussion/conclusion on the line of congition or learning, consider to review the title.             Comments:The manuscript is well structured and easy to read, and adds to the literature on stress coping styles in fish. In general, it will probably add to your discussion/conclusion  to review more deeply the references related to the HR-LR stress coping styles in rainbow trout starting with Pottinger, T.

", "This manuscript describes the association between rat sightings in New York City and several potential predictors.  Rats are a public health concern because they may transmit a range of bacterial and viral diseases, and they frequently share urban spaces with humans, yet their distribution and the factors that influence their population density are poorly understood.  The author identifies specific factors that are associated with increased reports of human-rat interactions.  As suggested by the author, understanding these associations is important to rat control efforts, but I believe this is understating the value of the work.  The author does not mention the utility of this work to epidemic modelers, who could incorporate this rat distribution model in a transmission model of rat-borne disease.  More broadly, basic ecology of species that thrive alongside humans is often neglected.  As urban (human) populations continue to grow, the ecology of urban (non-human) species will be of increasing importance.I have a few suggestions that I hope will improve the manuscript:1.)  The significance of using rat sighting data instead of a direct measurement of rat population density is only partially addressed.  Ideally, an observation model should be considered, if we are interested in inferring rat population density based on observations.  It's easy to imagine that rats might be more reliably reported in locations where they are more rarely seen, for example.  It's also possible that factors like human population density or socioeconomic factors could both affect rat population density and the probability that a rat will be seen and reported.  Although I do not feel the current work needs to incorporate an observation model in order to be publishable, the possible confounding factors should be more thoroughly discussed.2.)  The subsection titled \"Statistical Analysis,\" beginning on line 92, is almost entirely unsupported by citations.  The Moran I statistic, CAR models, and BYM priors should be appropriately cited, for example.  If the CAR implementation was part of this work, then details should be provided of how that was done, ideally including source code.  If a package like CARBayes was used, then it should be cited accordingly (i.e., Lee 2013).  If there are other details that the author can attribute to prior work, that would help readers understand the motivation behind the many decisions that go into research like this.3.) Lines 117-121: The font used for variables here is quite different from the font used in the equation.  Phi, in particular, looks like a completely different character.  I encourage the author to check that a consistent font is used for publication.4.) The results could be substantially clearer:(a) The census boundaries, traced with black lines in the figures, dominate large portions of the map and make it difficult to judge the fill color.  I would suggest not drawing any census boundaries.  Having the land/water boundaries traced would be nice, but I don't know how much flexibility is provided in the R package used to draw the maps.  Perhaps this could be solved with two shapefiles, one for the state of New York that would be traced, one for the census tracks that would not be.  As an alternative, it may be possible to shrink the black lines by increasing the width, height and res arguments to png(), and adjusting the plot font size (cex.main, cex.axis, cex.lab) as necessary.(b) Reproducing the &#8220;Rat counts by Census Tract in New York City&#8221; plot three times in Figure 3 is confusing.  There does not appear to be a difference between the plots.  Please clarify or remove the redundant plots.(c) The lower panel of Figure 4 would be clearer if the category including 0 were white, and the over and underestimates were shown in contrasting colors.  This could be done, for example, using cm.colors() in R.  As an alternative to the cyan-magenta spectrum, you can specify your own, e.g., mycolorfunction = colorRampPalette(c(\"blue\", \"white\", \"red\")).(d) The numerical results (Table 1, and text beginning circa line 150) are somewhat confusing.  An equation/explanation of how PRRs are calculated would be helpful.  The terminology doesn't help; there are no &#8220;rates&#8221; and &#8220;prevalence&#8221; is unclear.  I realize that there is historical baggage associated with the language.  On lines 158 &amp; 160, PRR is erroneously abbreviated RPR.  In the table, it would be nice if the predictive factors could be marked, for example with an asterisk.  If I understand correctly, it isn't really possible to rank them based on PRR in terms of &#8220;significance&#8221; because the magnitude of the PRR depends, in part, on the arbitrary units chosen.  Is there some other way to rank the factors, e.g. explained variance?5.) The discussion paragraph beginning on line 203 probably belongs in the introduction.  It does not depend at all on the results; rather, it provides motivation and context for the work in the first place.

For example, why was high school education used instead of socioeconomic data?  2) The author should focus more of the discussion on possible biases associated with using rat sightings reported to the NYC Dept. of Health.  For example, consider attempting to answer the question, \"what motivates someone to call the health department about rats?\" 3) Please include relevant citations for R packages.  If the author wrote code from the ground up, that should be indicated as well.  4) Please describe the details of the kernel density estimation.  5) In figure 4, it would be more helpful to plot the observed vs. expected frequency of reports per census block.  It's very difficult to assess the model fit with the plots provided.   6) What about vertical distance to the subway tunnel? or distance from the entrance to a subway?                 It seems clear that the shear size of the data set makes interpreting the results challenging.

At the very least, please consider re-doing the analysis with people, housing units, and structures per capita or per unit area.  I would also strongly recommend performing some kind of model selection.             Comments:The author presents an interesting analysis of an apparently under-represented topic.  With some revision, this could be a nice addition to our understanding of rat populations in urban areas.  However, I would strongly recommend re-focusing the modeling effort to better understand rat prevalence, as opposed to, the prevalence of rat sighting reports.                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.1182": ["In general, the manuscript is reasonably clear and well-written. I do have some questions and suggestions regarding the basic reporting.  1) There are some colloquialisms and awkward phrases that I recommend be removed or fixed, such as \"bewildering array\" (line 32); \"monolithic groups\" (line 50 and elsewhere); \"to zoom in on the impact\" (line 248); \"multiple evidences\" (line 251); \"the results provide experimental proof\" (line 310); \"wide range of uniqueness\" (line 55); \"Evidences of the presence of\" (line 314); what is meant by \"keystone physiological functions\" (line 65); \"severity of disturbance is highly logical\" (line 363) based on what theory?2) There are some ecological and evolutionary concepts that should be clarified or corrected:a) It is very important not to equate the rare biosphere with seed banks (\"seed system\" is an awkward phrase not commonly used). In ecology, seed banks refer to a collection of inactive or dormant individuals, which may be rare or abundant.  b) Disturbances refer to the removal or loss of individuals from a system. It would be more appropriate from an ecological perspective to refer to the temperature and salinity shifts as \"stressors\". c) The authors use the term resiliency in many places. There is a very specific definition for resilience (the rate at which a system recovers following a perturbation). The data in this manuscript would not allow one to quantify resilience.d) The authors make reference to \"fitness\" (line 355). It's not clear that the authors can make any inferences about the fitness of taxa from the data they've collected. e) On line 64 the authors seem claim that the existence of rare taxa suggests the play unique functions. It's important to note that hollow-shaped rank abundance curves can easily be generated from random sampling (neutral processes), where no unique traits or properties are associated with a taxon. So, the logic of this sentence is not entirely sound. f) On line 320, the authors state \"&#945;-diversity of an ecosystem\"; alpha-diversity can only be measured for a sample. g) On line 322, Can the results from this study with a single time point be used to make inferences about the taxa being conditionally rare? Or are more time points needed?3) In the introduction, I didn't find the first paragraph to be very effective because it emphasizes sequencing technology. In my opinion, this front-loading of methods (454 sequencing in this study) detracts from the more interesting questions being addressed. 4) There are certain stylistic issues that should be addressed. For example, starting on line 272 and in other places, the authors have a tendency to present there ideas as lists (e.g., \".2. And\") in a way that was awkward and hard to follow. In many places (e.g., starting on line 280), there are many vague references (\"those\" and \"This\"), which made arguments unclear. Last, there are many places with grammatical errors, including verb/subject agreements (\"High levels of beta diversity was observed\" [line 252]); the manuscript should be carefully edited to fix these issues. 5) Is it critical to have \"(Zodletone spring, OK, USA)\" in the title?                 1) On line 96, the authors state that \"Samples were stored on ice until returning to the lab\" until the experiments were initiated, which was less than 24 hrs. This seems somewhat undesirable to store samples on ice (below freezing) and then subject some samples to 70C temperatures. What was the temperature of the samples when taken from the field?2) Perhaps this is more of an Introduction comment, but no real justification is given for why samples were challenged with temperature and salinity stress. What's the context?3) On line107, the authors explain that they went to effort to run each treatment combination in triplicate. This is good. However, on line 111, it sounds as though the extractions from the experimental units within a treatment were then pooled. If this is true, it's very unfortunate.  The authors may want to check out this paper, which addresses the pooling issue: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/204385834) Line 141: It's not clear why the authors describe the cutoffs (which is sort of confusing; percent dissimilarity) since I did not take note of this aspect of diversity being revisited later in the manuscript. 5) Line 150: It's somewhat uncommon to define rarity based on total number of reads. This can only be justifiable if there are an equal number of reads across all samples. Was this definition of rarity performed on rarified data? Also, it would be useful to know what relative abundances corresponded to the n &lt; 10 cutoff. 6) Line 158: The authors state that they quantified beta-diversity with rarefacton curves. This is strange to me, since rarefaction is most commonly used to estimate species richness, which is an alpha-diversity metric. In general, I was a bit confused by the section starting on line 151. 7) Line 196: What is meant by \"original enrichment\"?8) Line 203: What about a \"demotion\" category? Wouldn't it be interesting to know what species dropped in the rank abundance curve?9) Is there a justification for why the authors spend some much time focusing on phylum-level taxonomy? 10) On line 231, the author discuss likelihood-ratio-Chi-squared. This should be moved to the Methods section and the authors should more clearly describe what hypothesis this technique is being used to test. 11) Line 250 \"Abundant community\": does this imply that the rare taxa were not included in the analyses?12) Figure 3: shouldn't there be stress values reported for NMDS? Also, typos/translation errors in caption. 13) Figure 4: What is \"RT\". Label the horizontal line at 10 for clarity. I'm not entirely sure what to take away from this figure. 14) Table 1: what is the \"rarefaction curve rank\"?                 1) The authors make a lot of inferences in their study based on Pearson Correlations. They report the correlation coefficients. However, they never show the correlation plots. I think the authors should present this information, if not in the main manuscript, then as Supplementary Materials. Some of the r-values are high, but it would be nice to see if the data meet the assumption of normality and equal variance. Also, the authors need to provide p-values associated with the correlation analyses. 2) The description of in the Results starting on line 261 needs to be revised for clarity. 3) On line 306, the authors state \"The magnitude of this promotion process is directly proportional to the severity of the disturbances\". I believe this brings up the comment I had on Perason Correlations described above. The authors seem to present some of the data in questions in Figure 2, but I do not feel that this is the most convincing use of the data to support their claim. I had a similar concern about the text on line 339.             Comments:1) The authors make a lot of inferences in their study based on Pearson Correlations.

There are previous studies that analyze the bacterial diversity of  the Zodletone spring sediments?, It is expected a high diversity?  Or should be present the main metabolic sulfur guilds:  sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e Desulfovibrio)  and sulfur oxidizing bacteria (i.e chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria: Beggiatoa, or  anoxigenic purple or green sulfur bacteria) If there is not sufficient information about the above, then  tittle is not making sense and is inadequate Physicochemical variables of the original sampleWhich are the physicochemical variables of the original samples (i.e temperature, pH, oxygen concentration etc). Did you replicate this variables in the mesocosms experiment?  Experimental controls: 2. The  \"negative control\" used, is not really a good control due to changes in community structure during the incubation time (60 day). **The ideal experiment it would take into account  the DNA extraction prior incubation period, in order to have the \"real\" community structure represented. **3. Due to the above the method is not suitable for testing the rare biosphere hyphothesis , if yo don't know the abundances of the members of the community of the REAL community (The fact of putting the  sediments in mesocosms involves a disturbance perse) . 4. Which criteria were used to  decide that changes in salinity and temperature were suitable to test  the hypothesis? As you described in the introduction there are other environmental disturbances ranging to pH, light exposure, nutrient levels etc. Why salinity and temperature in those ranges? They were chosen arbitrarily? . Other environmental disturbance within the ecological context of  anoxic-sediments,it would have been the changes in sulfur  (i.e Sulfate: SO42- and Sulfide H2s) concentration in the mesocosms.                 1. It is surprisingly that you don't detect sulfate-reducing bacteria in the analysis, or any related taxa capable of metabolizing sulfur compounds. Why in a sulfur rich sediment there are not \"sulfur\" representatives?. This is other reason why you need to know the \"real\" community structure prior incubation. In the introduction it is mention the plausible contribution of the rare biosphere to the ecosystem functions by acting as a backup or seed system that responds to various levels of environmental fluctuations.

They studied the ZBTB38 downregulation effects on SH-SY5Y cells: ZBTB38 SiRNA led to a decrease of cell proliferation and viability. Furthermore, the RNA-sequencing has deepened the analysis of ZBTB38 silencing effects, offering possible molecular mechanisms that could be implicated in the signaling cascade.This story would be of interest, however, there are some points that need clarification and additional experiments to strengthen the claims. Authors should better described the proposed experiments:e.g., They have &#8220;a total of 2,036 (83.5%) down-regulated DEGs and 402 (16.5%) up-regulated DEGs were selected&#8221;. GO analysis is confusing; it is not clear on which group they have done the analysis so it is difficult to understand the data.                 Major issues:- ZBTB38 is remarkable downregulated in UCEC and CESC tumor, but authors write &#8220;low expression of ZBTB38 was associated with improved the prognosis of the LGG (Brain lower grade glioma) patients (Fig. 2), suggesting that these changes are closely related to neuronal tumors.&#8221; What about UCEC and CESC? How do authors explain this point?- Taking into account the results, at present data do not support the working model in Figure 8: p53 pathway is proposed to be a key signaling, but it has not been identified by GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, why? - How autophagy is related to ZBTB38? Authors should check for autophagic flux by WB or ICC to verify that autophagy is impaired upon ZBTB38 downregulation. In S3 Table. (Top 20 differentially expressed genes associated with autophagy), there are genes that can have opposite effects on autophagy: for example, RB1CC1 (FIP200), ATG2 and ATM positively regulate autophagy induction whereas PIK3CA and PIK3C2A mediate the activation of AKT-mTORC1 cascade that inhibits autophagy through ULK1 (Laplante et al., 2012). Moreover, lose of PTEN, a phosphates that inhibits growth and proliferation signals of phosphoinositide 3&#8209;kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5&#8209;trisphosphate (Crino, 2016), should promote the AKT-MTORC1 activation. Thus, this point is unclear and needs further investigations to be clarified; I suggest checking AKT-mTORC1 activation state by WB.- They should provide results for ROS increase and apoptosis activation upon ZBTB38 silencing.- Figure legends are not complete or are not clear enough to read.Minor points:There are some typing errors.1 \tLaplante M, Sabatini DM. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.

Half of the participants joined the individual format, and half joined the group format. The aim was to investigate disparate effects of these different formats on physical, psychological and social well-being outcomes.The paper is very long for quite a simple message. The level of detail (while seemingly correct) reflects more a thesis format than a paper format. The paper would need to be shortened substantially to make it more digestible.                 While I am not familiar with the presented app or other studies/paper by the authors, I am somewhat concerned that the authors have divided their trial outcome measures across multiple papers. If this is the case, these other papers need to be stated more clearly and a reason for the multiple papers needs to be clarified. Also, in order to find a meaningful effect, the Otago program should be run over a minimum period of 4 to 6 months, not 2 months as in the current study. This is a limitation of the study design.                 After reading the paper, it seems to me that the results are very similar across both groups and therefore both formats show identical outcomes. The study sample is small for a 2-group intervention trial. Certain statements, such as &#8220;while in the Control group fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence&#8221; should be rephrased and put into context of the small sample.The app seems to have a substantial overlap with another app that I am personally more familiar with (Silveira).

While the idea is sound and the paper should eventually be published I'd like to raise a few issues which in my opinion are of importance in this context. First, the concept behind TCM is vastly different from Western pharmacology. TCM is based on synergistic action of many components, some of which are active, some supportive and some benign. However, all of them are used in low concentrations so the action of any individual ingredient does not overwhelm the totality of the composition. For this reason I'm skeptical that searching for individual chemical entities with potency which is sufficient to act as a single drug will be successful.                 The authors relied entirely on bioinformatic tools and no experimental validation of these findings is provided. This is still potentially useful but I would at least expect a deeper analysis in terms of common chemical features of the top ranking hits and perhaps docking to putative targets to predict their binding affinity. Ideally, a pharmacophore could be proposed by the authors which could lead to the design of novel drug entities.                 It's hard to comment on the validity of the findings since these are only bioinformatic predictions without experimental validation. It would be useful for those who could validate these findings to have information about the commercial availability of the top ranking compounds.             Comments:some of the websites cited in the paper are hard to access or to use.

Such a correlation could confirm activity of the prioritised compounds, or identify research opportunities.                 Satisfactory                 Again, I think this article could be strengthened by correlating the results of the data mining work with literature reports on bio-activity of the metabolites and TCM medicines with potential anti-tubercular activity.

The pipeline they propose is an assemblage of known methods that are cleverly selected, and their methodology is clearly presented, however the authors&#8217; claim for innovation is quite exaggerated and should be dropped as very close approaches have been used, including in similar groups, for a a couple of years. Specific points:- Title: &#8220;large scale data&#8221; is uninformative. Maybe &#8220;large scale molecular sequences&#8221; or something similar?- The authors choose two examples, Rhinebothriidae and Streblidae (arguments for this &#8220;selection&#8221; are lacking, one can only suspect that these were the samples available at time of the study) but in any case do not treat them equally in many respects: discussion, literature etc&#8230; with the flies kept mostly on the side. Although references are (over?)abundant in general in the text, they become rare for Streblidae (see e.g. line 284, why not a couple of key references here?). - The overall novelty of the proposed methods is certainly moot, see for example Brabec et al.(2016) IJP 46: 555-562 (for cestodes) among others who published very similar results for parasitic Platyhelminthes in the recent years. (Briscoe Par. Int. 2016, Digenea; Vanhove BMC Gen. 2018, Monogenea &#8230;).- On the other hand the authors choose to mention e.g. Maldonado 2017 which is about genome not mtgenome.. The overall selection of literature should be filtered again with a better coverage and focus. The claim of &#8220;taxon identification&#8221; (L78-80) is not correct if the taxon was not identified previously (name and reference sequence).- Minimum coverage value should be included besides mean coverage value (L160-270 and table 2). This would allow for a better representation of the data quality. - Also does the total number of sequences on L259  represent the number of  sequences or of *mapped* sequences??- The statement on line 294 is incorrect. See Egger et al. 2017 BMC Genomics for the presence of ATP8 in some flatworms! It would be correct for Neodermata though.- The claim of cost effectiveness needs to be substantiated with figures.

The manuscript is well written, methods are sound and discussion and conclusion well supported by the data. Although those mitogenomes will certainly be very useful for researchers working on related taxa in invertebrate systematics, since the manuscript is presented mostly as a methodological contribution my main criticism is related to how novel the findings really are. The main contributions seem to be related to (1) use of NGS to obtain mitogenomes at low cost based on (2) low amount of DNA of museum specimens in genomics of (3) non-model organisms. Certainly those are exciting points brought by NGS, but they have been extensively explored in many recent papers. In addition, much of that literature has not been mentioned in the paper, what makes the manuscript perhaps look more novel that it really is.  A few examples: https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781498729161/chapters/10.1201%2F9781315120454-9 https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=pt-BR&amp;lr=&amp;id=cMItDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT316&amp;ots=vUVKbbRifL&amp;sig=2DIPlqS0vLj2TXbuqs2B78lXhmY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falsehttps://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/04/1314445110.shorthttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138446https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.12466So my main question: what is really novel in this manuscript besides the assembled mitogenomes?  I understand that PeerJ focus on the on scientific validity and suitability to join the scholarly literature, but focusing on what is really novel will certainly make the paper more attractive to its intended audience. A few minor points: - Although I do agree that the biodiversity crisis is an important issue, it seems a bit disconnected to the rest of text. The intro could begin stronger dealing with topics that are closer to the paper main goals. - Mitogenomes are very useful, but stating that \"This set of attributes allows the mitogenome to be used for reliable taxon identification, which is the premise for any study involving biological organisms, specially in biodiversity.\" ignores all the issues that promoted the shift from mtDNA to nDNA in the last 15-20 years.- In some points the text sounds a bit like coming from a thesis or dissertation, as in \"Raw reads from each pair were pre-processed using a series of UNIX commands.\" By the way, it would be fantastic to the readers to have those commands/scripts available as supplementary material, which does not seem to be the case in the current version.

The fact that gold OA would cost more than green OA is apparent without doing the analysis.                 1.

Title, &#8220;Expected effects of an open access policy at a private foundation&#8221; This study does not address effects (including impact of the research if it is made freely available after a year, immediately, or never), only costs and journals that authors could publish in. Perhaps &#8220;Estimated costs of implementing an open access policy at a private foundation&#8221;7. The authors state, &#8220;&#8220;OA offers a number of benefits including increased citations counts (Gargouri et al. 2010), accessibility for building research capacity in developing countries (Chan et al. 2005), enhanced visibility of research (Tennant et al. 2016), and decreased financial pressure on academic and research libraries (McGuian and Russell 2008).&#8221; They state, &#8220;In an effort to increase access to the research results it funds&#8221; but which specific benefits were of greatest importance for the GBMF? How does their new policy address these benefits? 8. Why did the GBMF feel it was important to let authors publish where they normally would rather than encouraging them to publish in OA journals9. &#8220;grantee&#8217;s preferred journal&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s unknown what their preferred journal was; this was the journal they published in. 10. &#8220;GBMF plans to revisit the efficacy and impact over time for the newly implemented policy. There are several variables that can be altered to potentially strengthen the OA policy. These may include (1) restricting embargoes on archiving OA versions to six months (compared to 12 months); (2) requiring CC-BY licenses for all publications; (3) setting aside funds for covering grantees&#8217; OA fees (independent of their grant funds); (4) mandating particular repositories for OA archiving; or (5) expanding the policy to include outputs other than peer-reviewed journals (e.g., data, software, books, etc.).&#8221; It is surprising to see this statement after the analysis. Why was the decision to use the green approach made and what factors would make GBMF rethink that decision?11. &#8220;GBMF funds research in basic science, environmental conservation, patient care improvements, and preservation of the San Francisco Bay Area.&#8221; &#8220;Moore Foundation grantees tend to publish in hybrid journals (74% of journals; 72% of articles), with open (16% of journals; 17% of articles) and closed (10% of journals; 11% of articles) journals less represented.&#8221; The ratios of gold to green journals vary substantially by field (see Bj&#246;rk et al., 2010, doi: 10.1371/ journal.pone.0011273.g004 ). It would be useful to see whether the calculations vary substantially by field. 12. Cost estimates don&#8217;t take into account memberships (eg, In &#8220;Cambridge RCUK Block Grant spend for 2016-2017&#8221; https://unlockingresearch.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=1463 : &#8220;The average article processing charge was &#163;1850 &#8211; this is significantly less than the &#163;2008 average last year, reflecting the value of memberships&#8221;)             Comments:This paper provides the assessment conducted by a foundation in determining what OA policy to implement, and you should be lauded for being more transparent about your decision making than is often the case. However, the paper has a number of limitations. The limitations are in part due to the challenges of finding all the publications supported by GBMF and taking into account the actual APCs instead of the estimated APCs. However, if you don&#8217;t provide the caveats and frame the discussion appropriately, another foundation might look at this and make the same decision without digging deeper, which would be unfortunate. The decision-making process presumably involves weighing pros and cons, not simply (apparently) \"that's a lot of money, we can't afford that.\" Therefore, while the transparency is laudable, the analysis is fairly simplistic and it doesn't really rise to the level of research. While a formal cost-benefit analysis is presumably more than you are willing to undertake, what proportion of grants would have to not be funded to make up for the expense of funding OA? This sort of estimate would be useful.                                                ", "This paper presents an initiative of the private funding company for changes in their policy related to the open access to the articles written by the grantees. The study involves &#8220;more than 2000&#8221; publication in &#8220;more than 500 journals&#8221;, and approximate cost of OA, according two suggested OA policies, has been calculated and discussed.There are wrong definition on gold and green OA present: &#8220;Gold Open Access&#8221; journals which are considered only as journals with APC business model. It is well known that many gold OA journals do not charge authors. Also \"Green Open Access\" is not related with the journals but with authors who deposit their works (not only journal articles) into different institutional, subject based or other type of OA repositories.In the focus of the study are possible OA policies, but it is not clear why the funder wants to mandate OA. Benefits of OA for funders and researchers are not discussed. Funders have encouraged or mandated OA because enhanced visibility and discoverability increases the return of their investment, making the results of the funded research more widely available. Funder&#8217;s OA policy ensures the results of the research they fund can be read and used by anyone, including industry and society. Also, funder adopting OA policy avoids funding duplicative research, creates transparency, and encourages greater interaction with results of funded research. There are more benefits for researchers/grantees too. None of these are mentioned or discussed. There is only the phrase &#8220;potential implications&#8221; used in the discussion, but none &#8220;potential implication&#8221; is mentioned or discussed.The manuscript was written in clear and professional English.

"], "10.7717/peerj.5084": ["The interesting paper reveals the phylogenetic structure of a group of Hynobius salamanders from Japan, resulting in biogeographic inferences and the description of a new species. The study is novel and original, and the topic is attractive to PeerJ. The basic presentation of the manuscript however needs improvements before acceptance can be considered. Below are the main points that caught my eye: 1. While the language is of sufficient standard to enable comprehension of all lines of arguments, the entire text still needs to become polished for example by an experienced native speaker. Many sentences contain little grammatical errors and awkward phrases which are not picked up by a spell checker. One example is the frequent lack of the article &#8220;the&#8221; connected to respective nouns &#8211; see e.g. line 20, which should read &#8220;&#8230;..that cover almost the entire range of the H. kimurae &#8211; H. boulengeri complex&#8230;.&#8221;, and not &#8220;&#8220;&#8230;..that cover almost entire range of H. kimurae &#8211; H. boulengeri complex&#8230;.&#8221;. There are many similar passages, and generally many similar examples of phrasing which needs to be polished. Also be consistent with the spelling of important terms (e.g. &#8220;egg-sac&#8221; vs. &#8220;egg sac&#8221;; use the latter).2. Parts of the manuscript are arguably too long, and not all information is necessary to convey the main take home messages of the work. The &gt; 1000 lines of text (excl. references) are not fully warranted. Because so many taxon-specific details are presented, the current style of the manuscript often resembles a paper for example in Herpetological Monographs, and findings of general relevance are getting a little lost in between taxon-specific details. Aspects which could become shortened are the detailed taxonomic history of related Hynobius species (not everything is fully relevant for the present work), the natural history details linked to the species description (most of the presented facts are already published elsewhere), and somewhat repetitive parts in the Discussion and Conclusion sections. 3. The main lines of arguments throughout the Introduction and Discussion are not well aligned to each other &#8211; it is always advisable to raise a list of topics in the Introduction before revisiting them again in the Discussion. While bio- and phylogeography plays an important part in the Discussion, such topics are not covered al all in the Introduction. Related to this, the start of the Introduction straight goes into the taxonomy and distribution of Hynobius, whereas initially covering a more general framework of the study (e.g. on phylogeny or biogeography) would attract a wider audience to the work. 4. Some important terms needs to be treated with more care. Given the obvious, demonstrated morphological differences between the new species and existing taxa (also figure visualises these marked differences), is it really appropriate to refer to it as &#8220;cryptic&#8221; in the title? This term is generally used for species which are difficult or impossible to identify based on morphology alone. I am also a little uncomfortable with the term &#8220;species complex&#8221; for the taxa under study &#8211; which encompassed only a pair of species prior to the present work, which were also historically not always assigned to a single grouping.5. The figures are of particularly high standard &#8211; it is very evident how much work went into preparing them. Nevertheless it is a little questionable whether all 21 display items (14 figures and 7 tables, some of them very large) are really necessary in the main body of the paper, and whether some of them could be moved to a supplement/appendix. This might bring the key messages across in a more concise way.                 I am not an expert with all the analytical pathways applied, but the research question is well designed, and the Methods are described in sufficient detail. The data analysis follows established procedures, and appears overall sound. I only have the following two comments:1. The sample size is on the low size for some of the inferences. While sample sizes do not appear to violate any of the conclusions drawn, low numbers should become more acknowledged throughout the paper. For example, while Hynobius boulengeri plays an import part of the work (is one of the members of the &#8220;species complex&#8221; as termed by the authors), whereas actually only three individuals were available. For the morphological analyses, a range of parametric approaches was used (t-tests, ANCOVA), and I failed to find any information on whether data based on low sample sizes were normally distributed. Also, as far as I understand it, sufficient data to discriminate between males and females were only available for a subset of populations &#8211; how did this affect the overall analyses given that a fair degree of sexual size dimorphism was found? Given the extent of the manuscript I also might have missed the information provided.2. In the Methods chapter, morphological aspects are described before genetic aspects and analyses, whereas in the Results chapter genetics is covered before morphology. It would be better if the order would be identical in both chapters.                 I have no major criticism here. The conclusions are overall well stated, but (as outlined above) a little repetitive and not fully linked to the research question as outlined in the Introduction, where phylogeographic inferences are not well covered. The case in support for the description of a new species comes convincingly across, and all formal requirement for species descriptions appear to have been adhered to.             Comments:No further comments needed.

The study has clearly defined goals, is well justified, and makes a convincing case for the species status of H. fossigenus and provides a comprehensive taxonomic description of this species. The work is obviously based on impressive material and years of expertise. I don&#8217;t have any serious criticism regarding quality of science, but I feel that a major limitation of the paper is its length. While with online-only publication the length of the paper is not an issue from a technical/publishing side, it is still a problem from a point of view of the reader. In the case of this paper a rather straightforward message is communicated in an excessively verbose manner with large amount of descriptive material in the text. That imposes a heavy burden on the reader. Specific commentsAbstract is too long and contains unnecessary details, such as: the length of sequenced DNA fragments, details about statistical and phylogenetic methods, sample sizes for individual analyses etc. Briefly, I would suggest what you did and what you found while limiting methodological details. Time of divergence estimates values with two decimals make false impression of precision of the order that is not achievable with molecular clock analyses.l. 68-95 this history of research and a plethora of names makes a rather tedious read and disrupt the flow of the ms. Could you please consider moving it to an appendix or supplementary materials?l. 150 a single nuclear gene is a very weak (weakly informative) marker of gene flow, especially as only a single individual of H. boulengeri was used; please make sure that you discuss limitations of using only a single nuclear markerl. 242-46 ratios are rather questionable taxonomical tool.

Throughout the manuscript, there are numerous minor grammatical errors (e.g., omissions of \"the\") that I assume are due to nonnative English language. But I strongly believe that academic publishing should be globally inclusive and as accommodating as possible to scientists whose native language is not English, so I do not suggest the authors hire a proofreader or spend an excessive amount of time correcting very minor errors that do not in any way hinder clarity or understanding of the manuscript. Therefore, I did not mark any of those extremely minor errors; I primarily made corrections/suggestions for errors or phrasing that made the authors' meaning unclear. Overall, I was quite impressed with the writing!Minor but still important comments &amp; suggestions:- Would it be preferable to include the new species name Hynobius fossigenus in the title?- Abstract: too much detail. Abstracts should be short and concise.- L. 39: reword to omit \"basal\" -- this misuse of the term \"basal\" is very common in the phylogenetics literature, unfortunately. I suggest something like \"The H. kimurae - H. boulenteri species complex is sister to all other Hynobius except H. retardus.\" (To compare: Table 3 is a correct use of \"basal\" because it is referring to ancestral nodes, not lineages or extant species.)- L. 442-454: Is it necessary to present the same data here and also in the new species diagnosis?- L. 472-506: I'm not familiar enough with papers that include new species descriptions to determine what information belongs in this section vs. the Discussion below, and what information (if any) should be duplicated and presented both here and in the Discussion. Some of this seems repetitive, but it's A LOT of information, so it's hard for me to follow and really determine what is repetitive or not.- Fig. 2: it is very difficult to see gray vs. white node markers. I suggest completely eliminating the circle markers on unsupported nodes and changing the gray circles to white (i.e., black = strong support, white = moderate support). Also, specifically define the cutoffs you use for strong vs. moderate support.- Fig. 3: Does the gray shading on the inset paleogeographic reconstructions indicate above-water land? This should be added to the legend.Very minor comments &amp; suggestions:- L. 90: define the abbreviation \"mtDNA\" at its first use.- L. 231-232: \"presence of the whiptail-like structure (WT) and the following five characters were recorded\" - confusing wording. Why is WT listed separately from the other 5 characters?- L. 256: \"mtDNA\" already defined above- L. 342-344: confusing wording- L. 354 and forward: Seems strange to explicitly state e.g., \"Results of phylogenetic analyses are shown in Fig. 2.\" Usually, figures and tables are referred to parenthetically within the sentence discussing results shown in that figure/table.- L. 389: italicize species name.- L. 394-395 and caption for Fig. 2: reword. I don't think you mean to say you calculated genetic distance between 16S and cytb.- L. 418: reword. The data don't just \"suggest a possibility\" of this; they do show mito-nuclear discordance.- L. 435-454: It's cumbersome and a bit confusing the way these populations are referred to in this section. I suggest using either only the locality name (e.g., \"the Mt. Hinode population\") or \"western clade\" and \"eastern clade.\"- L. 456-457: I've most often seen PCA factors referred to as \"PC1\" and \"PC2.\" The terms \"F1\" and \"F2\" in biological literature usually refer to offspring generations.- L. 576 and forward: Seems strange to always spell out the full genus name of Hynobius fossigenus instead of abbreviating to H. fossigenus as appropriate, especially outside of the species description/diagnosis. I suggest changing this unless it is standard practice in papers that include a new species description.- L. 597: Is it normal for genetic diagnoses to be this vague and subjective? I.e., does more specific information from the Results section need to be repeated here or not? I am not a nomenclature expert...- L. 795-796: confusing wording. Do you mean the range of H. fossigenus (which would not make sense), or the combined ranges of all species in the genus?- L. 827-832: This is a confusing run-on sentence that should be split into 2 or more complete sentences.- L. 840-843: confusing wording.- L. 1013-1016: awkward run-on(?) sentence.- L. 1029-1035: This is just restating information already presented in Results and Discussion and doesn't need to be repeated here.- Fig. 10: \"egg sacs\" is hyphenated throughout the body of the manuscript but is not hyphenated in the legend for Fig. 10. I have most often seen the term as two words, not hyphenated, but this is a very minor issue.- Table 4: I suggest changing the headings \"Min-Max\" to \"Range\" to clarify that this should not be interpreted as the maximum subtracted from the minimum, and also because the values in those columns are referred to as \"range\" in the figure legend. Use of \"Min-Max\" alongside \"Mean&#177;SD\" is a bit confusing.- Tables 5-7: Should these tables be moved to Supplementary Information?                 Major issue:L. 90-94: I'm confused -- Weisrock et al. 2013 does not show H. kimurae to be sister to H. boulengeri, but instead sister to H. hirosei, and H. boulengeri is quite distantly related. In contrast, Nishikawa &amp; Matusi 2014 show H. kimurae sister to H. boulengeri, and H. hirosei is more distant. (I don't have access to Larson et al. 2003.) As far as I can tell, Weisrock et al. 2013 and Nishikawa &amp; Matusi 2014 both included H. hirosei from Shikoku Island, H. boulengeri from Kii Peninsula, and H. kimurae from Shiga (within western clade [H. kimurae sensu stricto] in this manuscript). The only difference is that Weisrock et al. 2013 sequenced 12S-16S and ND2-COI, whereas Nishikawa &amp; Matusi 2014 sequenced cytb. Is there another explanation for the discordance between the two phylogenies? A brief discussion of the conflicting phylogenies from Weisrock et al. 2013 and Nishikawa &amp; Matusi 2014 should be mentioned, especially since Weisrock et al. 2013 does not show H. kimurae to be sister to H. boulengeri. Also, I think it is important to include separate BI phylogenies for cytb and 16S, in addition to the concatenated data set, since these prior publications show very different phylogenies. The figures for phylogenies of cytb alone and 16S alone could be added to Supplementary Information, and a brief statement added to the Results...and to the Discussion if it turns out the two phylogenies are not concordant. Though, even when lotic/lentic is plotted on the phylogeny from Weisrock et al. 2013, the statement on L. 941-945 that stream-breeding adaptations have evolved multiple times still holds.Minor but important comments &amp; suggestions:- L. 236: Please explain why only this 1 population.- L. 288-289: Why were these additional sequences for H. kimurae and H. boulengeri included? E.g., were they samples from unique localities?- L. 292-294: Please explain here the purpose of this analysis with an expanded data set. From the current wording of this paragraph, it is not entirely clear that this is a separate data set and separate analysis from the data set and analysis described above in L. 289-290.Very minor comments &amp; suggestions:- L. 295-301: Confusing wording. I assume you first concatenated the data, then ran PartitionFinder, then determined from PartitionFinder results what your partitions should be. The phrases/sentences here should be reordered.                 Minor but still important comments &amp; suggestions:- L. 730-731: \"clearly corresponds to a species level of differentiation\" -- be careful how strongly this is worded. Determining the level of genetic differentiation sufficient for elevating to species status is essentially entirely subjective, so I don't think \"clearly\" is an appropriate word here.Very minor comments &amp; suggestions:- L. 357-359: It is often unclear what is meant by \"high resolution\" in phylogenetic context. Better phrasing is to note that phylogenetic relationships among major lineages were strongly supported.- L. 363-367: Where does this information fit in with the current study? Were these species once considered part of H. boulengeri? Meaning of \"former members of the H. boulengeri species complex\" is unclear.- L. 374-375: Reword. There was either moderate support or there was not. Trees don't \"suggest\" levels of support; the bootstrap/bpp data either support or don't support particular clades.             Comments:This is an interesting study on Hynobius salamanders in Japan. The authors use genetic and morphological data to show that the eastern clade of \"H. kimurae\" should be elevated to a new species, and they provide and thorough diagnosis and description of this proposed new species, Hynobius fossigenus. This study used only mitochondrial genes and 1 nuclear gene, but within their focal species complex the mitochondrial and genetic data agree that H. fossigenus is distinct from H. kimurae (despite mito-nuclear discordance regarding relationship to H. boulengeri), and their morphological data provide additional support for elevation of the eastern clade of H. kimurae sensu lato to species status as H. fossigenus. My only major concern with this study is regarding expanded analysis and discussion of phylogenetic relationships of other Hynobius species, and ecological conclusions based on that phylogenetic inference. This study will be an important addition to the salamander literature once the concerns below are addressed.

Comments:The point of this paper is to compare the TM and GMM methods for estimating sexual dimorphism in Au. afarensis in an effort to explain previously published discrepancies yielded by these methods.  Based on the standards outlined by PeerJ, I see no reason to reject this paper.  The goal of the paper is clear and unambiguous and the authors demonstrate how the work fits with previous related research.  I am not particularly familiar with the technical details of the methodologies compared here and I can make no claim to understand them fully.  Nevertheless, I do not feel that it is incumbent upon the authors to go into any more depth than they already do with respect to methodological explication.  All of the methods utilized here are already established and have been discussed extensively in previous literature.  Hence, I would simply note that I am not familiar enough with these methods to the point where I can definitively state that the conclusions of this paper are sound.  I can only note that the conclusions are appropriately stated and connected to the original question noted in the Introduction.  I would sincerely hope that this paper is also being reviewed by individuals who are more qualified to assess the technical content than I.  Overall, the research presented here represents a new piece in an ongoing controversy that will likely continue to produce (on both sides) labyrinthine and somewhat tortuous papers that I would hope to avoid.  As a final minor editorial comment, I would ask the authors to please remember to place a comma after any prepositional phrase that begins a sentence.

I had no real comments on the grammar or word choice. I will say that this debate has a long history, not simply between Reno et al. and Gordon et al., but also incorporating Plavcan et al. (2005)  and Scott and Stroik (2006). I think it is reasonable to acknowledge this and briefly talk about the major findings and differences, and the cause of these differences.                 The experimental design here is fairly simple and applies methods used in a number of previous analyses (Reno et al., 2003,2010, Gordon et al., 2008). It appears appropriate to their question. The description of the methods section could be improved (see below).1.Line 153: The Sampling and Bootstrapping Procedures - this section could use some work at clarifying what is going on, particularly with regards to the reference samples. Based on previous works, I believe the reference samples are used in a similar fashion as the fossils - compared to the AL 288-1 and KSD templates, and SD is calculated from there, but this is very unclear.2. I do wonder what would happen, rather than randomly selecting a new extant template for each iteration for the bootstrap comparisons of &#8220;biological error,&#8221; one template, such as a small, medium, and large extant individual was chosen (to mirror AL 288-1 and KSD) and the calculations were run using this one template for each randomly chosen sample of the comparative sample. Are the results the same given the changes in extant template size? In other words, is the pattern of dimorphism visible due to averaging over all possible templates rather than choosing one template as is done in the fossil analysis?                 I have no reason to dispute the validity of Reno and Lovejoy&#8217;s findings - the procedure used is not complex. In addition to measuring dimorphism in Au. afarensis using the template method, the main thrust of their argument is that the method of GMR from Gordon et al. (2008) is biased by AL 288-1 and AL 128/129 contributing to the dimorphism ratios of numerous traits, which leads to larger ratios for more traits and therefore on average larger metrics of SD. Unless I am mistaken this is fairly clear. This is in direct opposition to Gordon et al. (2008) statement that though some individuals may contribute more than one trait (page 323) to the ratios calculated, this will not bias SD because they will contribute only one trait to each dimorphism ratio. The other part of their findings are that Au. afarensis has modern human like levels of dimorphism, but this is simply confirming their results using a bigger sample and a different template.             Comments:This paper is another in a series of works attempting to determine the level of sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis. It is well-written and lays out the argument simply. It builds on the work and approach of of Reno et al. (2003, 2005, 2010) applying what is known as the &#8220;Template Method&#8221; to an expanded Au afarensis fossil record. The issue this method and other similar approaches were designed to deal with is that few complete fossil individuals have more than a few traits in common. These methods attempt to answer the question of how to compare dimorphism across isolated skeletal elements. The recent discovery of KSD-VP-1/1 provides a new &#8220;template&#8221; in addition to AL 288-1 on which to compare isolated elements, and in this case the new fossil is a large probably male.\tIn the TM, ratios between isolated fossil measurements and those of one fairly complete template individual (AL 288-1 or KSD-VP-1/1 here). These size ratios are then standardized by multiplying them by the FHD of Lucy, or the Distal Tibial Breadth for KSD. CVs, and DBI were calculated based on these standardized ratios and compared to similarly computed ratios for extant great apes including modern humans.\tThe analysis also attempts to show that the recently developed Geometric Mean Method (Gordon et al., 2008) is biased by the number of skeletal elements contributed by single individuals, and that by lowering the # of elements AL 288-1 and AL 128/129 contribute to 1, dimorphism appears reduced to modern human levels using this method. The manuscript concludes that Au. afarensis had a similar level of dimorphism as modern humans.Notes:1. Line 56 &#8220;Singular comparisons of its largest individuals (333-3) with Lucy have led to a common impression that size dimorphism was pronounced in Au. afarensis. However, Lucy and AL 333 could differ in age by ten to hundreds of  years, such that size variation may well reflect factors other than sexual dimorphism.&#8221; This is a fair point, though I would like to see a more recent citation for possible age difference.2. But, more importantly, KSD-VP-1/1, which this paper points out is one of the largest Au. afarensis so far discovered (with a calculated femoral head diameter larger than AL 333-3 using the recent regression from Plavcan et al. 2014), is older than AL 288-1. If the above argument is that time change or other factors may have led to the observable substantial differences in size between AL 288-1 and AL 333-3 (for example), what is the reasoning here? I think the line cited above opens the analysis up to criticism - especially if the argument is made as it is in the paper that 333-3 and 288-1 were just ends of a continuum that makes up Au. afarensis                                                ", "The authors do a good job of providing their fossil data in supplemental tables, which I greatly appreciate.  They also provide summary statistics for their comparative data.  While I&#8217;d love it if they also provided individual measurements for their extant taxa, this is not the norm for our field and they are providing everything that is current practice in our discipline.                 This manuscript is part of a continuing debate in the literature regarding sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis, and in part this manuscript is a response to some work published by myself and others (e.g., Gordon et al., 2008; Gordon, 2013).  I&#8217;ve identified four areas below where I believe that there are either errors in the methodology used in this paper, or inaccurate representations of factors influencing differences between the results of the template method and the Gordon et al. analyses.  These four areas are not all components of experimental design strictly-speaking, but I&#8217;ve grouped them here because they&#8217;re all related to each other.1. Reliability of template method estimatesAs has been pointed out elsewhere (e.g., Gordon et al., 2008; Gordon 2013), the template method assumes that all variables included in the analysis scale isometrically with each other.  This is not a point where there should be any argument because it is a demonstrable mathematical fact.  The template method first estimates values for a single reference variable (e.g., FHD or DSTB) using ratios between the values of that variable and all other available variables in a template specimen (e.g., Lucy or Kadanuumuu).  Values for the reference variable are then estimated for other specimens by having their measurements for another variable that is also present in the template multiplied by the appropriate ratio.  This assumes that the ratio between the reference variable and the other variable is the same in the template specimen and all other specimens.  Another way of stating this is that shape (i.e., the ratio of the two variables) is constant across all specimens regardless of size, which is the definition of isometry.  If the relationship between the reference variable and any other variable deviates from isometry or exhibits any variation about the isometric regression line, then this ratio technique will not produce accurate estimates.  That observation is incontrovertibly true, and there isn&#8217;t much point in arguing over it.  Where there is room for debate is over the questions of (1) whether the variables in a given data set scale perfectly isometrically with each other in A. afarensis, and (2) how much of an impact any deviations from isometry would have on a particular data set.  The complete answers to these two questions are unknowable without measurements from several nearly complete skeletons (and the authors have not tested those questions, their assertions in the text notwithstanding), but one can address part of the second question by investigating the accuracy and precision of estimates of a reference variable in a single specimen using a series of other variables or different template specimens to generate the estimates.One can get at this using the data provided by the authors in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 (and I again want to express my appreciation that the authors included all of their fossil data in this submission).  To begin with, there is one specimen which has an actual measurement for FHD for which FHD can also be estimated using Lucy as a template: A.L. 333-3.  The actual measure of FHD for this specimen is 40.9, but it would be estimated as 38.2 using A.L. 333-3&#8217;s measure of FNKH and the ratio between FHD and FNKH in Lucy.  That would underestimate the true FHD of this large individual by 6.6%.  Of course, there is no way of knowing if other large individuals that don&#8217;t preserve FHD are similarly underestimated (and more broadly, if estimates are inaccurate in general).If one then turns to specimens where actual FHD isn&#8217;t known (which prohibits us from investigating accuracy) but several estimates are possible using different ratios in Lucy as a template, one can evaluate precision.  For example, A.L.322-1 is reported in Table 1 as having an estimated FHD of 32.2 based on CAPD.  However, it would have an estimated FHD of 33.8 using HARB, and 27.9 using OLCB.  That&#8217;s a difference of 5.9 between the maximum and minimum estimates, which is more than 19% of the midpoint of the range of these estimates.  Shifting to DSTB estimates based on Kadanuumuu, DSTB in A.L. 128-1/129-1 is reported in Table 1 as estimated at 19.0 based on FLCL.  However, it could also be estimated as 16.4 based on TMXT (which is smaller than the actual DSTB value of 17.2 in Lucy, and would act to increase estimated dimorphism in A. afarensis if used instead of the 19.0 estimate).  Furthermore, if Lucy is used instead of Kadanuumuu as the template, five estimates of DSTB can be generated, ranging from 16.0 to 17.5, all of which are considerably smaller than the Kadanuumuu-based estimate.  Similarly, A.L. 322-1 is reported in Table 1 as having an estimated DSTB of 19.7 using Kadanuumuu, but three estimates of DSTB ranging from 16.8 to 20.3 are produced using Lucy (a range that is 18.9% of the midpoint value).Additionally, as the authors point out, the choice of reference variable and template is arbitrary.  If one estimates FLCL in Lucy using either A.L. 128-1/129-1 or Kadanuumuu as a template, there are eight possible estimates ranging from 33.9 to 41.7, values whose range is 20.7% of the mean of the estimates (and 20.6% of the midpoint).  This is a very large range of variation.The point of all of the above is that the template method produces estimates that are imprecise at best, and that the data set that is used to calculate BDI or CV is highly dependent on which individual is selected as a template and which variables are used to estimate from; this would not be true if all variables scaled isometrically with each other across all specimens.  Furthermore, there is no acknowledgment in this manuscript that different estimates are possible using different variables from the same template specimen for many of the specimens included in this analysis, nor any rationale for how the particular estimates that were used in this analysis were selected.  This is a significant problem with the research design that needs to be addressed.2. Sex assignmentIn the discussion, the authors make much of the overlap in size between males and females in humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos, where they imply that mean method results are unreliable because (they argue) such methods assign sex to each individual, with presumed males above the mean and presumed females below the mean for any given variable.  However, this is a red herring.  The mean method does split a sample at the mean and calculate a ratio of the mean of the larger material to the mean of the smaller material, but it is recognized that this is not a direct measure of sexual dimorphism (which, if it were, I agree would imply that the members of the large group are all male and the members of the small group are all female), but rather one way to estimate relative size variation in the fossil sample (just as the coefficient of variation is another).  It should be noted that BDI also splits the sample into specimens larger than a particular value and smaller than that value, then calculates the ratio of the means of the two groups.  The only difference is that BDI iteratively calculates all such possible ratios where the number of individuals included in the group of larger specimens ranges from 1 to n-1 (and vice versa for the group of smaller specimens), where n is the total number of specimens, and then a weighted mean is calculated of these ratios.  The point is that the ratios averaged by BDI also assume no overlap in size between the group of larger individuals and smaller individuals, just like the mean method.  Not surprisingly, for a given set of univariate measurements both BDI and the mean method tend to give very similar results (e.g., see Fig. 1 in Gordon et al., 2008).  Just like the coefficient of variation (CV), the mean method and BDI are measures of relative size variation that are correlated with sexual size dimorphism, but are not themselves measures of sexual size dimorphism.  It is misleading to suggest that just because BDI and the mean method split a sample into two non-overlapping groups to calculate a measure of relative variation, then it follows that the use of either the mean method or BDI means that one assumes that there is no overlap in male and female size in the fossil sample.  What is true is that the mean method and BDI tend to produces ratios that are very similar to actual dimorphism in extant taxa when males and females don&#8217;t overlap in size (e.g., in gorilla and orangutan postcranial measurements), and they produce ratios that are high relative to actual dimorphism when there is overlap between the sexes (e.g., humans, chimps, and bonobos) (Plavcan, 1994; Rehg and Leigh, 1999; Gordon et al., 2008).  What is also true is that when extant samples with size overlap between sexes have mean method ratios that are high relative to actual sexual dimorphism ratios for those same samples, they are not elevated into the range of highly dimorphic taxa like gorillas and orangutans (Gordon et al., 2008; Gordon, 2013), so it is not accurate to suggest that gorilla-like mean method ratios for A. afarensis are simply the product of an incorrect assumption that there is no overlap in size between the sexes in A. afarensis.3. The number of times specimens are represented in various methodsThe authors argue in multiple places that the geometric mean method of Gordon et al. (2008) places undue weight on specimens that are more complete than other specimens through &#8220;multiple inclusion&#8221; of such specimens.  This assertion of undue influence is incorrect, and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of a key difference between the template method and Gordon et al.&#8217;s method.Both methods incorporate information from multiple variables into an estimate of relative size variation using two steps of estimation, although the steps differ for the two methods.  The template method first estimates values for a single reference variable using presumed isometric scaling relationships among all variables, then estimates relative variation in the resulting estimated data set using whatever preferred method one cares to use (e.g., BDI, mean method, or CV).  Gordon et al.&#8217;s method first estimates relative variation in all variables separately, including only actual measurements (as opposed to estimated), using one of the relative size variation methods (again, it could be BDI, mean method, or CV), and then estimates overall relative size variation in the data set as the geometric mean of those estimates of relative variation in each of the individual variables.  So if the Gordon et al. analysis had a similar first step to the template method, then in using all measurements from Lucy it absolutely would create a cluster of highly similar estimates for a single reference variable that would unduly affect the subsequent measure of relative variation.  However, the Gordon et al. analysis doesn&#8217;t have such a step.  Instead, each specimen is included exactly once in the calculation of relative size variation for every variable in which it appears.  It would be highly misleading to calculate measures of size variation for both FHD and HHD in which Lucy was included in one but not the other; Lucy really does have both a femoral head and a humeral head.  To calculate a mean of ratios for FHD and HHD in which Lucy is represented in both ratios is not counting that specimen twice, but rather combining estimates of size variation for different variables in which every specimen that has a measurement for that variable is included exactly once.4. Changing LucyThe authors also include analyses where Lucy is increased in size and the influence of Lucy and A.L. 128-1/129-1 on overall size variation is evaluated.  I agree that if Lucy were made 30% larger, or if Lucy and A.L. 128-1/129-1 were removed, A. afarensis would appear much less variable.  However, Lucy and A.L. 128-1/129-1 are the size they are.  The authors seem to be arguing that because these are the two smallest specimens in the sample, their effect on size variation should be discounted.  That same argument could be used to remove from the analysis all specimens that deviate from the mean.  The fact is that these two specimens do exist and contribute to the overall variation present in the sample, and that can&#8217;t be argued away.Citations:Gordon AD. 2013.

Even if one were to accept that the methods used here were sound (see my comments above), there is still a significant problem with the interpretation of results.  Just as in previously published versions of this work, the authors choose to focus on the result that their measure of postcranial relative size variation does not significantly differ between A. afarensis and modern humans, arguing that therefore A. afarensis had modern human-like dimorphism (and by inference, a modern human-like level of sexual selection).  However, if one examines the template method results, Table 2 shows that for BDI and CV, A. afarensis is either not significantly different from, or has significantly greater values than, chimpanzees, and in six out of eight tests is not significantly different from gorillas (the values in Table 2 can be converted to one-tailed p-values by dividing the number of resampled extant values that at least as extreme as the A. afarensis value by 1000, the total number of resampled values).  The authors argue that the small samples (i.e., all samples except the Combined Afar sample using the Lucy Template) produce relatively wider distributions for comparative extant taxa than larger samples (which is true), and as such those results (which do not allow them to differentiate A. afarensis values from the means for humans, chimpanzees, or gorillas) should be downplayed in favor of the results based on the largest sample.I disagree that those other results should be set aside as uninformative due to small sample size, because the authors are trying to make arguments about the influence (or lack thereof) of using Kadanuumuu as the template specimen and the differences between analyses based on different templates are almost certainly not due solely to sample size differences.  But for the sake of argument I&#8217;ll focus only on the results they highlight, those of the Lucy-based Combined Afar sample.  While the authors are not explicitly making the incorrect argument that failure to reject the null hypothesis means that the null hypothesis is true when they state the level of dimorphism in A. afarensis is human-like, they are implying that flawed argument.  But even if that observation is correct, they have not adequately explained how to interpret a level of variation that is simultaneously not significantly different from humans and greater than that seen in chimps.  Decades of work in primates has shown that high levels of mass dimorphism are associated with social structures that allow for high degrees of sexual selection, and chimpanzees are both more mass dimorphic and subject to more intense sexual selection than modern humans.  The problem is that humans have unusually high skeletal dimorphism compared to their mass dimorphism, so that they are more skeletally dimorphic, but less mass dimorphic than chimpanzees.  The authors provide a potential explanation for why this might be based on sex differences in tissue distributions in humans, but this doesn&#8217;t address the problem that a human-like level of skeletal dimorphism that is also significantly greater than chimpanzee skeletal dimorphism is equally strong support for a level of sexual selection that is higher than that seen in chimpanzees (and thus also higher than in humans) as it is for a lower level of sexual selection similar to that seen in modern humans.  At the very least, the authors should acknowledge this point in their work.             Comments:Leaving aside for the moment my criticisms above and addressing the rest of the manuscript, although I don&#8217;t agree with much of the inference and interpretation presented in the discussion and elsewhere (and I don&#8217;t want to extend an already overly-long review to address these things point by point), much of this boils down to differences in interpretation, which in my book is not a reason to argue against the publication of something that is otherwise technically sound.  I&#8217;m not convinced by all of the arguments presented on the last couple of pages of this manuscript, but they introduce some interesting ideas that I would have liked to see fleshed out a little bit more and that would be interesting to have a conversation about.

Comments:Review of &#8220;From Lucy to Kadanuumuu: Balanced analyses of Australopithecus afarensis assemblages confirm only moderate skeletal dimorphism in the species&#8221; by Reno and LovejoySummary of the manuscriptThis manuscript is the latest in a series of papers by the authors and their colleagues dealing with the problem of sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis. Prior to their first publication on the subject in 2003, several studies had reached the conclusion that size variation within the skeletal and dental samples assigned to this early hominin was high, suggesting a level of body size dimorphism at least as great as that seen in the most dimorphic living hominoids (gorillas and orangutans). The analyses conducted by Reno, Lovejoy, and colleagues, including the one under consideration here, challenge this view, with these authors interpreting their results as indicating a much lower, humanlike pattern of dimorphism.The current contribution is novel in two respects. First, it includes material from the recently discovered KSD-VP-1/1 partial skeleton, referred to as &#8220;Kadanuumuu,&#8221; which appears to represent a large and presumably male individual of A. afarensis and expands the range of size variation in an important subset of the sample for this species. Second, and more important, the authors attempt to reconcile their results, which have remained consistent since 2003, with those of a study that was critical of their work, conducted by Gordon, Green, and Richmond (2008), who reached the conclusion that A. afarensis was much more dimorphic than extant humans. Reno and Lovejoy conclude after a series of analyses that their methodological approach and the one taken by Gordon et al. should produce similar results. They then evaluate a number of explanations for the conflict in the case of A. afarensis. The one they favor is that Gordon et al.&#8217;s analysis includes multiple measurements from two of the smallest individuals of A. afarensis discovered to date&#8212;A.L. 288-1 (the famous &#8220;Lucy&#8221;) and A.L. 128/129&#8212;and that this multiple representation at the small end of the size range biases the results of the analysis toward finding high dimorphism, because it gives these very small individuals undue influence on the results.Major criticismsMultiple representation of single individuals and sample composition have been persistent problems in the debate over dimorphism in A. afarensis since Reno, Lovejoy, and colleagues published their first paper on the subject in 2003. One of the criticisms directed at Reno, Lovejoy, and colleagues&#8217; work pertains to the way in which they treat a subset of the A. afarensis sample from the A.L. 333 site. Most paleoanthropologists, including Reno and Lovejoy, recognize that the 26 fossil specimens from A.L. 333 were contributed by far fewer individuals. The exact number is not known. Reno and Lovejoy assume n = 9 for their analyses, which is the minimum number of individuals (MNI) estimated from dental remains at the site. However, as pointed out by Plavcan and colleagues in their 2005 response to Reno, Lovejoy, and colleagues&#8217; 2003 paper:&#8220;The strict MNI for the postcranial elements measured by Reno et al. is only three (the maximum number of duplicated parts) for adults, and four including the subadult specimens used byReno et al. The actual number of individuals represented by postcrania is, of course, unknown, but is almost certainly greater than four. However, reasonably clear associations between many of the A.L. 333 postcranial elements (some of the Reno et al. specimens actually appear to be antimeres) suggest to us that the postcranial sample used by Reno et al. comprises between five and eight individuals&#8221; (Plavcan et al., 2005, p. 314; this reference is conspicuously absent from Reno and Lovejoy&#8217;s reference list, though they do mention that &#8220;previous simulations sampling from as few as 5 individuals to represent A.L. 333 did not substantively alter our results&#8221;; see lines 171&#8211;172).So, on the one hand, Reno and Lovejoy criticize Gordon et al. for including multiple specimens from the same two individuals in their analysis, but on the other hand Reno and Lovejoy include multiple specimens from the same individuals in their analysis. Why is there a double standard here? If Gordon et al.&#8217;s treatment of A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 128/129 is confounding their analysis, why doesn&#8217;t the inclusion of many elements from a small number of individuals at A.L. 333 confound Reno and Lovejoy&#8217;s analysis? This difference in treatment gives the impression that the authors are trying to have their cake and eat it too. Also, if there isn&#8217;t a substantive difference between modeling the A.L. 333 specimens as coming from 5 individuals vs. 9, then why not take the more conservative approach and model it as containing 5? By using 9, the authors are opening themselves up to critics who have used this issue to challenge Reno, Lovejoy, and colleagues&#8217; results previously.Related to the issue raised above, Reno and Lovejoy conduct an interesting exercise to demonstrate the effect of A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 128/129. They limit both of these specimens to contributing a single measurement each to the estimate of dimorphism in A. afarensis (i.e., 2 measurements instead of 10) and find that this lowers the estimate of dimorphism. This is similar in some respects to an exercise conducted by Scott and Stroik (2006) in their analysis of the effect of reducing the data contributions of the A.L. 333 individuals. Scott and Stroik found that limiting the A.L. 333 contributions resulted in an estimate of size variation that could not be statistically distinguished from chimpanzees, humans, or gorillas. Why haven&#8217;t the authors of the present manuscript conducted a similar sort of exercise for A.L. 333? If Gordon et al.&#8217;s sample deserves that level of scrutiny, then why not Reno and Lovejoy&#8217;s? Not doing so leaves the reader with the impression that the authors are not approaching the two data sets in a balanced way. As noted by Reno and Lovejoy, Gordon et al. (2008) conducted analyses in which they constrained the smallest two individuals in their bootstrap samples to contribute specimens in a manner identical to A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 128/129. The results of those analyses differed in some ways from the other (unconstrained) analyses, but the overall signal was not qualitatively different in that it indicated substantial dimorphism in A. afarensis. In modeling A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 128/129 in this way, Gordon et al.&#8217;s approach is similar in some respects to Reno and Lovejoy&#8217;s approach to modeling the A.L. 333 sample. So why is the latter approach okay but not the former?Reno and Lovejoy conduct a separate analysis that excludes the A.L. 333 specimens, which allows them to avoid some of the difficult issues discussed above. The authors describe these results as follows: &#8220;The smaller non-333 sample also shows a similar pattern (Figure 3B), although it just fails to reach statistical significance at p = 0.05 level for both chimpanzee (low dimorphism) and gorillas (high dimorphism) (Table 2).&#8221; The p-values in question range from 0.073 to 0.084, and they are all one-tailed. Why? What a priori reason do the authors have for conducting one-tailed tests rather than two-tailed tests? In the case of the comparison with gorillas, one reason might be that the authors think the gorilla represents some kind of upper limit on dimorphism in primates. If that is the authors&#8217; view, then they should make that explicit. However, they&#8217;d still need to address the work of Jay Kelley and colleagues suggesting that greater levels of dimorphism are possible and in fact characterize living (e.g., papionins) and extinct (e.g., Lufengpithecus and other Miocene apes) primates. Given that possibility, it seems that a two-tailed test is most appropriate in these sorts of comparisons. Without a robust justification for using a one-tailed test, the authors are violating the rules of null hypothesis significance testing (which apply to resampling methods), once again opening themselves up to criticism. The authors are not alone in misusing one-tailed tests in this context; this practice is common among biological anthropologists, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s correct. Doubling the p-values in Table 2 to approximate two-tailed values renders the statistical results far less supportive of the authors&#8217; preferred interpretations.There are also problems related to the interpretation of the statistical results. Strictly speaking, the authors are conducting tests of equal relative variation between samples. A significant difference means that the relative variation is not equal, whereas a nonsignificant result means that a difference in relative variation cannot be detected. The authors interpret a significant result as indicating a difference in sexual dimorphism, whereas a nonsignificant result indicates a similar level of dimorphism. Such interpretations are reasonable, but they are not the only interpretations. For example, one criticism of Reno, Lovejoy, and colleagues&#8217; work that has been raised by multiple critics is that the low level of size variation in Reno, Lovejoy, and colleagues&#8217; sample might reflect an unbalanced sex ratio. Previous studies (e.g., Plavcan, 1994, AJPA) have shown that, where the sex of specimens is uncertain (as is the case here), measures of size variation such as the CV can underestimate the true level of sexual dimorphism. So, when the value for a fossil sample of unsexed individuals is compared to a distribution generated by bootstrapping from a sex-balanced sample of gorillas, and the fossil value is found to fall at the lower end of the resulting gorilla distribution, does that mean the fossil species had a lower level of dimorphism, or does it mean that the fossil sample is sex-biased?It has been argued that the bootstrap accounts for sex bias because not all of the individual bootstrap samples (or even most of them) will be sex-balanced. But as any introductory text on resampling methods will tell you, bootstrap distributions reflect the statistical properties of the sample that was used to generate the distribution. If the original sample is sex-balanced, then the bootstrap distribution will reflect that balance. Therefore, such bootstrap distributions cannot account for sex bias. This is an important point, because in the type of analysis conducted by Reno and Lovejoy, the fossil value is compared to the distribution; the sex composition of any single bootstrapped sample matters little, because it is the entire distribution and its statistical properties that are used in the statistical evaluation of the fossil value. In order to directly examine the effect of sex bias, the bias needs to be built into the resampling protocol. (Note that this also applies to modelling the contributions of the individuals in the A.L. 333 sample; the effect in the number of individuals in the sample needs to be examined explicitly, even if not all of the 9 bootstrapped individuals contribute to the calculation of dimorphism in each iteration of the procedure.)The potential for sex-biased fossil samples to mislead our attempts to estimate sexual dimorphism in fossil hominins is illustrated very well in Lockwood and colleagues&#8217; 2007 analysis of Paranthropus robustus in Science. If those authors are correct, then the P. robustus sample is heavily biased towards male individuals, a situation that has led to underestimates of dimorphism in that species. Lockwood and colleagues develop a scenario that might explain why the P. robustus sample is biased, which is worth consulting, but sex-biased samples can result from random processes as well. Whether or not the A. afarensis sample, or parts of it, is sex-biased is obviously not known, but the possibility that it is, and that the bias affects estimates of size variation, and therefore estimates of sexual dimorphism, needs to be confronted in a substantive way. Other commentsReno and Lovejoy treat the measures of variation for the A. afarensis sample as point estimates, free of error and uncertainty. This practice is typical for this sort of analysis, usually because fossil samples are so small that confidence intervals are meaningless. However, in this case, Reno and Lovejoy&#8217;s sample is not small; in fact, it is quite large, and the authors discuss the importance of maximizing fossil samples. The descriptor &#8220;large&#8221; applies even to the subsets of the sample; with an n of 16, the non-A.L. 333 sample size is enormous in terms of what paleoanthropologists normally deal with. So why not also bootstrap the A. afarensis sample and its various subsets to create distributions that can be compared to the distributions for humans, chimps, and gorillas, like Gordon et al. did in their analysis? That approach would be more conservative and therefore more statistically robust.The authors state in lines 298&#8211;302: &#8220;However, mass and skeletal dimorphism do not have the same relationships in humans and apes, making the task of inferring mass dimorphism from skeletal dimorphism difficult for early hominids (Reno et al., 2003; Gordon et al., 2008; Plavcan, 2012b). Instead, we have avoided this conundrum by simply focusing on skeletal dimorphism, an important indicator of total size and sex differences in growth (Hamada and Udono, 2002; Reno et al., 2003).&#8221;And lines 355&#8211;356: &#8220;the three most closely related living taxa to Au. afarensis, humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos, all show substantial overlap between the sexes.&#8221;Furthermore, in lines 361&#8211;362: &#8220;Appreciable overlap between the sexes would suggest an absence of targeted selection for increased male size.&#8221;Chimps and bonobos have lower skeletal dimorphism than humans but higher body mass dimorphism. Chimps, bonobos, and humans all differ in their reproductive strategies. Given that we estimate body mass from the skeleton in fossil species, doesn&#8217;t this mean that we can&#8217;t really infer anything about A. afarensis reproductive strategies with any degree of confidence?

I have a major concern on the methodological strategy followed to determine the inhibition of the pancreatic lipase by different chitosan molecular weights. In general the results are not presented using enzimological nomenclature and key methodology information is missing to fully understand what the authors have done and how they arrive to their conclusions. For example: what is the source of the lipase? Numerous pancreatic lipase have already been kinetically characterized with natural and synthetic substrates. I was not able to evaluate if the results of inhibition were previously known without the source of the lipase. Also, the authors should define enzymatic units and inhibition rate. The methodological strategy to characterize an inhibitor depends on th type of inhibitor it is. If not known, then the experimental design has to contemplate it. It is extremly important to know at which substrate concentration the enzyme is working in saturating conditions. I assume this was the intention of the authors with the \"optimum enzyme concentration experiment\". Kinetic parameters (if not previously reported) could have been provided after this experiment. Also for further experiments the authors claim to use this \"optimal substrate concentration\". For some inhibition experiments it is extremely important to work under saturating conditions (10 Km).

The inhibitory effect on the pancreatic lipase will also be once improved.

The authors might have provided information, or a comment on whether any tissue-specific SEPP1 isoforms are known that migbht correspond to different selenium needs in different tissues.                 1. This reviewer does not understand why a complex second-order polynomial was used to fit the relationship between selenium content of the SEPP1 protein and dietary selenium requirement for mammals and two fish species.Clearly, as seen even by naked eye, this relationship is very well approximated by a linear relationship.This reviewer believes that a Pearson correlation coefficient together with its significance estimate should be reported and a linear relationship should be used.2. Instead of quoting a complicated \"asymmetric sigmoidal\" relationship for the dataset including mammals and fish, it should suffice to say that selenium requirement in fish does not depend on selenium content of SEPP1.                 1. The dataset (number of species studied) is so small that the authors were not able to divide it into training and validation subsets.Therefore it is obvious that the model can correctly predict the data that were used to build it.

It is desirable that the authors try to include data on humans, if possible,and vertebrates other than mammals and fish (birds, reptiles, amphibians).3. Perhaps the authors could comment whether the lack of relationship betweenselenium requirement and selenium contein of SEPP1 in fish could be related to the fact that selenium is available in seawater. Perhaps different relationships could be observed for sea fish and freshwater fish.Anyway, the clearly visible difference between fish and  mammals deserves more comment.             Comments:1.

In cases where a species SEPP1 has &gt;16 Sec residues (in several fish species), the current model predicts a minimum requirement (0.24 mg/Se kg dry matter).

In my opinion, the manuscript can be a much better and robust if this analysis can be made with more N values and more representatives are included. At least such analysis at the informatics level is not difficult. In this work, the authors used only few fish sp and few mammal sp only and has not commented on the other species, such as birds, reptiles and amphibians. This makes the claim very incomplete. In addition, some of the invertebrates could also be includes in such analysis as a \"out group\" or as controls. At present, there are several genome sequences are available. So obtaining SEPP1 sequence is not difficult for a number of species. A domain/motif wise calculation of different regions (as performed by (Sardar et al. 2012, PlosOne) of SEPP1 will be much helpful and actually needed to support the positive correlation in all vertebrates. Such analysis can replace the figure 1 in a very precisely and conservation of different domains/motifs will be clear. In addition, a careful search should be made in order to see if any invertebrates have same/similar gene/protein. An interesting aspect is that all fish leaves in water and thus trace minerals in their body is subject to infinite dilution (as a spontaneous process) if not prevented. This is in contrast to the other sp which does not survive in water, say in human. On the other hand, certain mammals, and reptiles spend their entire life cycle in water. In that context, does it means that more Sec is required to prevent loss of this trace mineral? Authors may comment on that and also include certain mammal which lives in water (such as whale) in their system to study.   Table 1 suggest that Se content of few species were not determined. Reason for that is not clear.                 comment above             Comments:xx                                                "], "10.7717/peerj.5207": ["Please check at line 115 the term \"previously\"                 The weaknesses of the study are well described from line 169 to line 188.In particular, the use of the tissue adjacent to the tumor as a control could represent a strong bias; the authors could add a histological characterization of this tissue in order to confirm its non-tumor origin.                 no comment             Comments:no comment            ", "the article is clearly written and well structured.                 Although the topic of reference gene selection for RT-qPCR experiments is not novel, the experimental set-up by which the authors first screen microarray and sequencing data to come up with candidate reference genes makes this paper stand out. However, I have one major concern about the method used for comparing and selecting the most stable reference genes. The authors do not sufficiently disclose which software package was used to ompare the reference genes. This is important as some applications (such as Reffinder) do not take the PCR efficiencies into account. And this can impact the ranking of the genes, see De Spiegelaere et al. (Plos One,      https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122515)The authors should use the original software packages for Genorm, Normfinder and Bestkeeper or they should use open source packages (such as packages in the R environment) that allow us to validate whether the algorithms are appropriately used. Second, the Reffinder tool also performs a combined analysis of reference genes, but here again, the methodology is not based on statistically sound data but a mere summing up of four tools, of which the last (the delta CT) is not even a frequently used method to explore reference gene stability. Hence I would not recommend the authors to use this 'combined analysis' do describe their research results.Hence, I would strongly recommend that the authors step away from the reffinder tool and use peer-evaluated software packages to reperform their analysis. Or, in case they did not use Reffinder as the sole sourse, then they should clearly write this out.                 The validity of the finding stands and falls with the use of Reffinder, as small differences in gene ranking may occur when PCR efficiencies are not taken into account.

Comments:Well written manuscript that is addressing the internal control genes for gene expression studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, some point of major and minor criticism should be considered. Major points1.\tIn the comparative  Ct method the authors used 2^  Ct values (also see the difference of designation in table 1B and Figure 2B), but the classic comparative  Ct method operates with values of Mean Standard Deviation (MeanStdDev) of  Ct for each genes in pairs with each other genes from author's discovery set (see ref. Silver et al., 2006). Comparative  Ct method is similar to geNorm methods but uses only Ct values and do not uses amplification efficiency as geNorm does. Authors should add the MeanStdDev values to the manuscript and change the Results and Discussion section accordingly.2.\tDissociation curves are not enough for evidence of specific amplification. Analysis of PCR products by gel electrophoresis using DNA markers should be done.3.\tAccording to the results provided by the authors the RPL30 and RPL27 genes show the most stable expression indeed. However, choosing the genes as a minimal set of reference genes has an important limitation that both genes belong to the same metabolic pathway. Therefore, the authors should propose at least one more gene from the other metabolic pathway to exclude an error due to a mutual expression alteration of the ribosomal genes. Minor points1.\tOn Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 provide the diagrams in the same order for reader convenience.2.\tIt should be provided the exact values of amplification efficiency for each gene based on the amplification efficiency graphs on Supplementary Figures 1.3.\tIn Table 1B delete the \"1\" from \"Normfinder 1\" column name or explain what does in mean.4.\tOn Figure 2B all axis Y should be named or none of them.5.\tCorrect the typo in word \"Quantitiatve\" in line 106.References(Silver et al., 2006) Silver, N., Best, S., Jiang, J., &amp; Thein, S.

Did the authors guarantee the same tree was not generated multiple times (the same 5 taxa removed)? The source code for the script used may be a nice addition.                 This study is very interesting, and provides another tool for high-throughput phylogenetic analysis. I feel the study presented here is slightly inadequate for publication by itself. Seeing running time alone is interesting but does not really help a reader understand wall time in comparison to other methods. I understand that the time for PhyloSort are infeasible but  you should be able to get the timings from SICLE to compare with. You could also estimate the time to compute the classification of one tree using PhyloSort and extrapolate to give an idea of the standard running time of that program.It would be nice to provide confirmation that the software released is able to confirm results found by other pieces of software (i.e. of the trees produced, making sure that all of them are &#8220;Exclusive&#8221; in PhySortR, PhyloSort and SICLE).

The command-line nature of the tool and its ability to detect non-exclusive associations mitigates some of the methodological and biological challenges that plague high-throughput phylogenetics and merits its publication. However, there are several places where I feel the manuscript could use additional clarification. Major comments1. Allowing for the user defined association to be 'non-exclusive' is the real selling point of PhySortR. However the authors only highlight one biological process (endosymbiotic gene transfer) when justifying this feature's necessity. In fact, there are many other aspects of high-throughput phylogenetics, both biological processes and methodological issues, that make this a very nice feature (e.g. other forms of LGT, sequencing contamination, taxon sampling, etc). The authors should devote a section of the introduction to these challenges as context and justification for their program.   2. In the introduction, the authors state that all currently available tree-sorting utilities screen a set of trees for a user-defined association of interest (e.g. Identify all trees in which 'Viridiplantae' and 'Rhodophyta' are monophyletic. Here, the 'target' is the association being evaluated). However, the program SICLE, which the authors cite, actually describes all sister clades to a node of interest and does not take a user-defined association as input. For example, in SICLE, the target could be 'Viridiplantae' and the program would return all the nearest neighbors to 'Viridiplantae' across all input trees. 'Rhodophyta' would likely be a neighbor in many trees, but the program would return other associations as well. The difference may be subtle, but PhyloSort and PhySortR are programs for hypothesis testing, whereas SICLE is for hypothesis generation and bulk summary. Both approaches are valid and useful, but the distinction should be stated in the paper. 3a. Lines 47-54 starting with \"Existing utilities...\" to the end of the paragraph are very confusing. The hypothetical 100-taxon tree is not described in enough detail to make the example helpful. Is the tree made up entirely of members from the two target groups? Are sequences from both targets interleaved, or is each target monophyletic? An example figure would be helpful here (see comment #4), as would a real world example such as the one presented in the second methods paragraph (lines 55-60). 3b. The min.prop.target argument allows PhySortR to identify 'clades' of interest even if the target of interest does not form a monophyletic group in the tree (even when clades.sorted is set to exclusive). I realize the phylogenetic challenges mentioned above may necessitate such an argument be included, but the authors should explain and justify this more. My concern being, if min.prop.target is set too low, then interpreting the biological significance of any returned clade becomes very challenging. 4. Figure 1 should be expanded to include the full phylogenies, and the authors should demonstrate clade.exclusivity as well as min.prop.target arguments in these diagrams. As it is now, the reader doesn't know if taxa X and Y are present elsewhere in the phylogeny and to what extent. 5. The authors refer to the terminal nodes of trees as 'taxa', but this is only appropriate if the trees being evaluated represent species phylogenies. The input for PhySortR could be gene trees in which a single taxon may be represented by multiple sequences in an alignment and hence multiple nodes. This is particularly important for clarity when discussing the benchmarking results presented in Figure3. Therefore, the authors should use a less specific term in place of taxa/taxon (e.g. leaves). Minor Comment6. It seems like the program would be more intuitive if the clades.sorted and clade.exclusivity were collapsed into one argument. If this was implemented, when clade.exclusivity is set to 1.0 the clades are exclusive.

They did GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and reported that the down-regulated genes in anoikis-resistant CAL27 samples were enriched in cell cycle, while up-regulated genes enriched in extracellular exosome, and up- or down-regulated genes were accordantly related to VEGF and EGFR pathway. They did RT-PCR experimental validation of some differentially expressed genes, and then focused on validating VEGFA-STAT3-KLF4-CDKN1A signal axis.In general, I thought this study is good, but the English and some logic may need to be improved. The authors seem to fail to mention some related literature references in introduction or compare with them in discussion, for example PubMed ID 22154512, 16007176. The article structure is professional. Figures and tables are mostly good and self-contained. Raw data can be found in SRA (SRP158985).                 This study is within the scope of PeerJ. The research question is relevant and meaningful, but not very sharply defined in the Introduction section. Analysis and Results look good, although some methods may need more details.                 The RNA-seq experiment was done on three anoikis-resistant CAL27 samples vs three control CAL27 samples. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) are defined with the standard that is not very clear and is changed several times, and I am not sure about the statistical significance of DEGs. Multiple test correction (FDR or Bonferroni or q-value) was not done for the first part of GO enrichment analysis by DAVID. The conclusion part may be a little more than that the results can support.

And I think 'deep transcriptional analysis' looks strange, which might be better as 'deep sequencing data for whole transcriptome analysis'.Line 70, the word 'meticulously' has fuzzy meaning; I am not sure what 'the key signaling pathways' refers to; 'discovered' might be strong.Line 95, I am not sure what 'as described previously' refers toLine 97-98, what are 'Loget' and 'probability'?

The abstract is a good example.The in silico work is not adequately introduced (for me, a non-expert in that field).Figure 1 is not needed, data is in the text. Legends need more information so the individual figures are stand alone.I think there are two studies, first the lab experiments to justify and underpin in silico studies (which I am not convinced that they do), and second the in silico experiments following a clearly justified strategy (which is not apparent in this draft).                 The strategy for screening against clinical isolates, testing anti-biofilm effects and cytotoxicity is OK. The choice of TP1 for further study is not well justified. The in silico section does not have a strategy justifying the validity of the experimental design, and the in silico studies research question is not clearly stated and definitely not aligned to the stated aim of the manuscript in general: AMPs as alternative therapies in the background of resistance to conventional antibiotics. Plus other comments in the comments to authors.                 I think there are some basic errors in the research (possibly at calculation or interpretation stage) that are concerning; e.g. 10e12+ CFU per ml in a microplate well culture, stating a reduction of 7.8 log CFU/ml to 4.2 log CFU/ml is a 2 fold reduction. Plus other comments in the comments to authors.             Comments:The development of antimicrobial resistance is a serious public health concern. Some bacteria, e.g. Burkholderia pseudomallei also have high levels of intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. The development of further resistance in B. pseudomallei means there are some strains now resistant to many previously usable antibiotics, and increasingly for some people meliodosis does not respond to antibiotic treatment. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a good alternative candidate to conventional &#8220;antibiotics&#8221;. The manuscript under review examines AMPs as a potential treatment for meliodosis by first screening the activity of a range of AMPs against a range of B. pseudomallei isolates. LL-37 and PG1 show best range and lowest MICs, but TP1 is chosen for further study without convincing justification. No comparison of AMP activity profiles is made to any data that might be available for the isolates tested (e.g. API20 NE profile, clinical presentations, antibiotic sensitivity profile). Anti-biofilm activity is tested as an expansion of the data, this is a good strategy but there are serious problems with the presentation and interpretation of this data (see specific comments). SEM is used to begin to give some gross mechanism data, but the evidence presented does not really support the conclusions made. In vitro toxicity testing with a range of cell lines suggests that TP1 is more toxic to mammalian cells than B. pseudomallei, but no consideration is given to how this finding may suggest that TP1 is unsuitable for therapeutic use for meliodosis.A substantial section is devoted to in silico analysis of TP1 and identification of proteins that TP1 may interact with. I do not consider this my area of expertise, but make some high-level comments in the specific details. I do feel the manuscript is long enough without this information and this section would be best left out and used as the basis of a separate manuscript.Overall, the figures presented need legends that supply information to make the figure stand alone. For example the concentrations of AMPs used must be stated clearly in the legend. I do not believe that supplementary information is appropriate for an online journal &#8211; it is either needed for the paper (include it) or not (leave it out).Specific comments.Abstract. Too long and rambling. It needs to be re-written to be more succinct and highlight findings.Introduction.Line 64. What do the authors mean by &#8220;phenotypically mutate&#8221;. Is biofilm formation more correctly described as phenotypic adaptation, without necessarily requiring any mutation, which I would class as a genotypic change.Line 71.

Begin the sentence with Groups of &#8230;The overall strategy of the in silico approach to drug design here needs to be clearer; i.e. identify something that works and use an in silico approach to generate hypothesis for mechanism of action and new designs for better acting drugs. Specific examples where this approach has been successful should be briefly described.Methods.Peptide storage and Preliminary screening. Please indicate the concentrations of stocks and tests for the preliminary screening. It would also be helpful to include molar concentrations and g/l concentrations for each.MIC and MBC of planktonic cells. Why was RPMI used as the medium? The methods do not look like internationally accepted methods for measuring MIC or MBC that would be used for &#8220;antibiotics&#8221; so should be given a brief justification. Dilution of the cells in RPMI will give a final concentration of 0.8x RPMI, which should be commented on. The same comments apply to the testing of anti-biofilm activity.Please indicate more than the range of concentrations, i.e. doubling dilutions for 200microM? Or state the actual concentrations tested. . The same comments apply to the testing of anti-biofilm activity.Assays were performed in a U-shaped microplate, followed by measurement of absorbance at 570nm. I think flat bottomed microplates would be needed for Absorbance readings. How was the MIC decided upon, i.e. how much inhibition was needed? Please explain exactly how the time to kill curve was performed, first I don&#8217;t see how A570 (as stated in the manuscript) can be used for this, unless there is a high inoculum and reduction in absorbance due to cell lysis is measured. Plating should be used, and the Sieuwerts method stated used plating- but how much medium was used?, I think the experiment states taking 24 x hourly readings from 0.1ml total volume.Results.Preliminary screening.Figure 1 is not needed, the information is in the text. For TP-1 83/100 strains were susceptible, but this was calculated at 83.33% (it is 83%). The use of 100.00% also is 2 too many decimal places. Please also indicate here or in the methods the criteria for classification as sensitive.No comparison of AMP activity profiles is made to any data that might be available for the isolates tested (e.g. API20 NE profile, clinical presentations, antibiotic sensitivity profile). This should be done, even if there is no correlation observed, and this may only be possible for TP1 where there are sensitive and insensitive isolates.Please justify selection of TP1 as the AMP chosen for further study, LL37 and PG1 hit all the isolates and are more potent (lower MIC/MBC).Time to kill.The section repeats the results description, please rewrite to be more concise. Figure 2 is of concern, the untreated reaches a concentration of 10e12 or 10e13 cfu/ml, and what the methods suggest is in a microplate well. My experience is that this number of cfu may be obtained from a litre of bacteria grown overnight in a rich medium, not per ml in 0.8x RPMI in a microplate. I suggest checking calculations and if they are correct then the method used has some deficiency or artefact. I am happy with the data being used for time to kill (with limits of detection) based on those platings that do not grow bacteria, but not with the enumeration of cfu, which is clearly incorrect.The comparison with CAZ, a drug in clinical use against B. pseudomallei is a good control. Are the amounts CAZ used clinically relevant?Anti-Biofilm activity.The presentation and interpretation of results needs to be thought about and redone. The first line states, The number of &#8230; biofilm forming cells (7.84 log CFU/ml) was reduced by two fold (4.2 log CFU/ml)&#8230;. This is almost a 3 log reduction in CFU! (1000 fold reduction). I would also use CFU per biofilm in the assay well, not the concentration in the suspension released from the biofilm.In figure 3 DJK5 is *&#8217;d with a significant effect, but the graph does not support this. If there is a reduction it is very small. An important set of findings here concern LL37 and PG1, and CAZ and MRP. LL37 is not active against the biofilm, while PG1 appears more active than TP1, and should be discussed regarding the choice of AMP to study further. CAZ and MRP, the classical antibiotics appear most active, this should be discussed and the experiment should be repeated with isolates resistant to these antibiotics to demonstrate benefit of the AMPs. Fig 4 should be discussed with correlation to planktonic MIC/MBCs, MIC planktonic is 221 microM, maximum anti-biofilm effect is seen at 442 microM. Also looking at the anti-biofilm effect here the limit of detection (LoD) of the test should be indicated, I wonder why the graph plateaus 1x10e4 CFU per ml? How many colonies on the plate does this correspond too? And are we at the LoD? Fig 5 looks at the key treatments, but values differ from Fig 3. The legends really need to state the concentrations of each antibiotic and AMP used. In Fig 5 LL37 is *&#8217;d, but this is an increase in CFUs and should be highlighted as such. I would recommend highlighting (and testing for) the treatments that reduce bacterial numbers.SEMA small number of cells in one image per treatment is given. Only 2 cells are in 6A. If any conclusion is to be made on cell dimensions this needs to be on a substantial number of cells, e.g. 6 fields of view containing &gt;50 cells and from three independent experiments.  The data should then be graphed, and analysed with appropriate statistics. Line 290. I&#8217;m not certain on the statement that cells are 5 micro m in length. In Fig 6B there look like pairs of cells that have divided, but are still attached, and here the pair is not 5 micro m in length. It may be that complimentary techniques, e.g. using a membrane stain and fluorescence microscopy, is needed to confirm this. Line 290. Where there are references made to specific features in an SEM image these should be indicated with e.g. an arrow.Figs 6B and D. Is the &#8220;debris&#8221;, debris of killed cells and are they blisters and bubbles on the cells? Or maybe it is aggregating protein? Perhaps an image set of an AMP and a resistant isolate would help as a comparison? Overall, the interpretations from the SEM are not supported by the data presented.Cytotoxicity.In vitro toxicity testing with a range of cell lines suggests that TP1 is more toxic to mammalian cells than B. pseudomallei. What does this mean for the therapeutic use of TP1, as alternative therapies are the proposed aim of the study? Perhaps this should also be compared to LL37 and PG1, where there is data in the literature already published showing at least for LL37, and it is more toxic to bacterial cells than mammalian cells.  The discussion (e.g. section beginning Line 465) considers action as an anti-cancer agent, which is an aside that does not address the key findings that suggest TP1 will be toxic to human cells at doses that are anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm. Armed with these toxicity results, would an animal or human ethics committee approve animal experiments or human trials? I think the answer would be no.In silico molecular docking.This is not my area of expertise, and I am not qualified to comment on the specific methodology. The actual proteins interacting with TP1 are not clearly identified. I would be more overt in reference to Figure 3. I feel this table would also benefit from predicted or known cellular location of the target protein (i.e. are they surface exposed). I did struggle to see the strategy justifying the in silico experiments, especially as this could easily be tailored to the design of an anti-meliodosis agent that is potent against B. pseudomallei while not affecting human cells at therapeutic concentrations. In addition the relevance of AMP binding to proteins is only addressed at the end of the discussion, as possibly a route to aiding the clearance of bacterial lysis products. So, again I wonder if the strategy is viable and would like to see this clearly explained.

Too many examples to list them all, but see for example, line 88 (\"also highly potential\"), line 90 (\"There\" should be three), line 92 (\"several\" should be few), line 103 (\"give\" should be \"gives\"), line 113 (\"MDR\" is not a thing to combat.  Combat bacteria or drug resistant bacteria, not MDR).FIrst paragraph of Introduction is not necessary - delete.  No issues of antibiotic resistance are dealt with in this paper.Second paragraph of Introduction should begin with \"Burkholderia pseudomallei\" as the first paragraph of the introduction.The major issue with this work is that it does not meet the criteria of representing \"an appropriate &#8216;unit of publication&#8217;, and should include all results relevant to the hypothesis.\"  The work begins with some in vitro antimicrobial assays, and then a computational prediction of binding of the peptide to 26 Burkholderia proteins is presented, but no experimental confirmation or validation of the predicted interactions is presented.  Thus, this part of the paper is fundamentally incomplete and does not prove the hypothesis.Screening results at 1 mg/ml peptide against the bacteria (line 392) suggests that the peptide is not very active indeed.  Also this concentration is not mentioned in the methods (line 150) and should be there and indicated in Figure 1 legend.  What is the molarity of this concentration?  These experiments are very far from the reported MIC levels (62 uM).  It would also be of interest to list in the supplemental the 20 strains that were resistant to TP1 and some analysis of why that might be.                 This work fails to meet the standard in two places.1)  Anti-biofilm assays are presented.  However, this experimental approach and the authors data shows that the peptides aggressively kill the bacteria within the biofilm.  Thus there is no direct antibiofilm effect, only a bactericidal effect as was previously shown in the paper, and as a result of few bacteria remaining, there is less biofilm produced. This is not an appropriate understanding of the concept of an antibiofilm peptide or an antibiofilm approach.  It would be acceptable to state that the peptide can kill bacteria that are in a biofilm, but that does not mean that TP1 is an \"antibiofilm\" peptide as currently is written.  \"Antibiofilm\" is a direct regulation of biofilm production in live bacteria, not the killing of bacteria.  Ceftazdamine is not antibiofilm, it is 100% bactericidal. These experiments are more appropriately performed at sub-MIC concentrations to account for this issue.2) There is no validation of the purely computational prediction of binding of the peptide to 26 Burkholderia proteins is presented. No experimental confirmation or validation of the predicted interactions with Bp cycle inhibiting factor is presented.  Thus, this part of the paper is fundamentally incomplete and does not prove the hypothesis.  Also, this analysis severely under-represents the totality of proteins in Burkholderia, only testing 26.  The odds of one of those 26 proteins being a true target of the proposed peptide is very unlikely.  No positive control (a protein known to interact with an antimicrobial peptide) is presented for comparison to know if the cutoffs proposed by the authors have any biological relevance.                 There is no validation of the purely computational prediction of binding of the peptide to 26 Burkholderia proteins is presented. No experimental confirmation or validation of the predicted interactions is presented.  Thus, this part of the paper is fundamentally incomplete and does not prove the hypothesis.  Experimental association of the proposed protein with the peptide needs to be demonstrated to prove the computational prediction.Also, this analysis severely under-represents the totality of proteins in Burkholderia, only testing 26 out of the 6000-7000 CDS in B. pseudomallei.  The odds of one of those 26 being a true target of the proposed peptide is very unlikely.  No positive control (a protein known to interact with an antimicrobial peptide) is presented for comparison to know if the computed interaction value cutoffs proposed by the authors have any biological relevance.  A computational demonstration of another known protein-peptide interaction should be run as a comparison.  For example, LL-37 was recently shown to interact with a bacterial protein AcpP and there is a known interaction of LL-37 with the P2X7 receptor.  Other cathelicidins can interact with Lpp on Pseudomonas which could also be modelled.

Although the research is overall well conducted and some of the results of potential interest, I do feel some changes are required before it could be accepted. MAJOR ISSUES- Methods regarding the CD4 determination are not specified.- I think that the results discussed in the section &#8220;results&#8221; should be presented while several times you talk about findings without showing the actual data (&#8220;data not shown&#8221;). I feel it would be more correct modify the paper reporting these data; alternatively I would suggest not mentioning them in the section &#8220;results&#8221; and maybe talk about them in the discussion section if felt necessary. Please, consider modifying the paper accordingly.- In the discussion it looks like that the behaviour in terms of low CD4 and CD4/CD8 ratio is independent on the fact that RTX is used as maintenance treatment, this does not seem clear to me from the results section; although I appreciate the number of patients in your cohort not receiving maintenance rituximab is very low, I think a section in the results should be dedicated to that.- Figure 1 and paper text referring to it: it is not specified anywhere what the numbers are: mean? Median? Other? This need to be clarified in the method section and in the figure explanation. Due to the small numbers, in order to have an idea of the degree of reliability of the data, I would suggest to report range or interquartile range in the form of &#8220;error bars&#8221; in the graphs.MINOR ISSUESLine 119, ODPD and CYC: need to be defined somewhere also in the text before using these abbreviations.Line 132: how was the low CD4 definition established?

I like your work, your embedding in the literature and the conclusions you draw from your computational experiments. I have some questions and comments, and a, what I think, important suggestion that I&#8217;d like to hear your thoughts on.To start with the latter:I think the strong difference between survival rates of competitors and defenders could be due to an &#8216;imbalance&#8217; in the model: plant growth (equation 2) depends on biomass, both through the zone of influence and the ratio with maximum biomass. Biomass does have a contrasting effect on plant growth through both parts of the equation. It would be nice to see the graphs for some different values of biomass for overall plant growth in the appendix, to get more feeling for what the equation implies. In addition, herbivores damage plants by eating a certain amount of biomass, equal for big and small plants, and don&#8217;t spend more time on one than the other. This means that big plants suffer relatively less from the same number of herbivores. In all, biomass is what drives the plant&#8217;s survival probability.(btw: I seem to miss the values for rgr in the paper, are they different for different species?)And related to this a question: during a run, no new plants appear in the plot, right? So survival rates are a maximum of 1? This means I guess that if a good competitor outcompetes its neighbour (which would usually be replaced by a new competitor), it&#8217;s after that care-free, with a bigger zone of influence than before. If all this means that large biomass is relatively important in the model, it also makes sense that defence values don&#8217;t matter: if herbivores are not important then defending against them doesn&#8217;t either. We do see trade-offs in the native plant traits, but under model simplification one benefit can overwhelm the other.(Speaking of which: it seems that 3 native plants have lower seed weight than what is called &#8216;weak&#8217; for non-natives?)Other comments:I think the study (apart from some minor issues) is very well-written and explained. Sometimes even a bit apologetic, as if using a model needs special conditions or warrantees. In line with this:-ln. 64-67: turn around: non-successful expansions cannot be tracked in the field, and we need full control to test certain hypotheses here, so we use a model.- ln. 68: a greenhouse is not reality either, you do not need to apologise. rephrase please.- 74: this should be the view of any person interested in range expansions, leave out the modeller&#8217;s view.- 101: you can make this statement in the discussion, no need to apologise here.- 111: first mention of dispersal. I value that you show the bigger picture and maybe some reviewer asked for including all this. But I find it confusing to talk about dispersal when it is actually not included in the model..-130 vs 138: 3-dimensional trait vector vs 4 plant traits?-139: plants always hatch from seeds :)-176: so 1 cm2?-185: what is the purpose of stochastic density of herbivores: is this also not a reason that biomass is valued over other traits? If a herbivore remains in a spot, it would do so on a large plant I guess..?-220: I guess the same comment as for dispersal: I value that you explain how you actually had herbivores move during a simulation, but for this purpose I would just leave out how you solved this technically and just say they chose a new random position each day.-233: another one: if you remove herbivores that cannot eat on defended plants, without them bothering other undefended plants with it, this gives a relative advantage for undefended plants. In real life I guess the herbivore would continue searching for a plant that it can eat.- I don&#8217;t understand how you get from eq 3 to eq 4. Maybe something for the appendix (&#8216;appendix for the stupid&#8217; :)- 271: but theta was between 0 and infinity? (ln 261)- 289: note that = so- 292-294: I don&#8217;t understand why you do this: is this a trade-off: strong competitors likely maintain more biomass but set less seed per amount biomass?-304: parameterization?-334: omit &#8216;from reality&#8217;-344: so no new plants during the simulation? Which would make survival rates &gt;1-365: to catch up-388: because strong competitors end up competing with each other?                                                ", "The article is generally well-written and follows the ODD protocol structure. This is slightly different to a traditional research article layout but it is commonly used for individual based models and is appropriate here. The authors provide a good background for the study in the introduction and the references cited are appropriate. However, on occasion the language used is a little hard to understand. Some sentences are quite long and convoluted, and other times the grammar is not quite right, common mistakes include e.g.&#8220;are interacting with&#8221; should be &#8220;interact with&#8221; (line 175), &#8220;is representing&#8221; should be &#8220;represents&#8221; (line 146). I provide some further examples at the end of this section. In general, I would recommend that a native English speaker provide feedback on the draft before publication. I also think it would be good to make clear early on that this model has been parameterized using data from a greenhouse experiment, along with some basic information about the experiment &#8211; even though the authors provide a copy of this manuscript (thank you!), just some general details e.g. when the experiments took place, the basic design, what species, etc. would be useful to know early on rather than mid way through the paper. At the moment this information is drip-fed throughout the paper, which makes it a little hard for the reader to keep track of. The raw data has been shared (the netlogo model), however I think that the article could be improved by sharing the R code and model outputs as described in lines 352-358. I talk a bit more about this in section 3 of the review. Some examples of where language &amp; grammar could be improved:Line 27-28 and 30-31 - sentences are quite hard to follow, can you replace &#8220;as compared to&#8221; with &#8220;than&#8221; perhaps?Line 43 &#8211; it is not clear who &#8220;they&#8221; refers to hereLine 46 &#8211; you use both the terms &#8220;range shift&#8221; and &#8220;border shift&#8221; &#8211; I suggest for consistency only using the first of these terms as multiple terms can become confusingLine 48 &#8211; suggest &#8220;include, for example, ..&#8221;Line 130-131 &#8211; Can a vector be 3D?

The introduction is well laid out and explains the state of knowledge well, as well as placing the study in a wider context. However, I think it would benefit from explicit hypotheses or aims at the end, as the current sentence at the end is a little vague and does not strongly describe what knowledge gaps the research is filling. The methods are extremely detailed and I commend the authors on their use of the ODD protocol and for providing their model. I can confirm that the model works and that the code is well-commented and laid out so that a third party can understand it easily. The technical quality of the work is high and I cannot find fault with it. My only suggested improvement here is that the binomial GLM models could be more fully described in the text (i.e. replace &#8220;and all two-way interactions&#8221; with the variable names), as well as how they were assessed (e.g. were data normalized/standardized, were residuals checked, how was the model assessed for degree of fit etc). This, along with providing the R code for these models, would greatly help improve reproducibility. Another minor comment is that the info tab of the netlogo model is blank when I open it on my computer &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if this is because I&#8217;m using a newer version of netlogo or because the info tab hasn&#8217;t been filled out. If the latter, I recommend doing so to make the model more user-friendly.                 The data appear to be robust, and the conclusions are well linked to the introduction and research question. However, it is difficult to fully assess the robustness of the results as there is no sensitivity analysis of the model. I would recommend running a full sensitivity analysis for all parameters and presenting these results in a table, as it is difficult to assess the validity of the model without this information.I think that before publication it would be good to expand the results section &#8211; personally I would like to see the results of a sensitivity analysis, the results of the scenarios, as well as the results of the binomial GLMs described in the text. Currently, the results text is a bit vague and lacking in detail, and as such it is hard to assess the robustness of the conclusions even though the authors provide some of this information in figures and tables.             Comments:I very much enjoyed reading and reviewing this paper and have no doubt that it will be up to the standards of PeerJ after some minor editing as described in the previous sections. Thanks to the authors for providing clearly-commented code and for following the ODD protocol, this is something I really think we need more of in the modelling literature!My main suggestions for improvement (in order of importance) are:1. Provide sensitivity analysis results for model parameters2. Expand upon results section text and description of GLMs in methods3. Improve grammar and reduce wordiness throughout My recommendation (minor revisions) is based on the assumption that the authors have already done a sensitivity analysis during model construction. If this is not the case it could be quite a significant undertaking, if that is the case and if the authors decide not to include a sensitivity analysis, I think this needs to be addressed and justified in the methods as it is fairly standard practice. My other comments are just minor suggestions. Thanks again to the authors for their well-laid out paper, I had a lot of fun playing with your model, it's very nicely done!

I recommend the author consider restructuring the introduction. The opening paragraph describes Caribbean yellow-band disease distribution and its history in five sentences. The next paragraph discusses generally, coral disease outbreaks followed by a paragraph that outlines previous treatment attempts for various types of disease, then back to Caribbean yellow-band disease for the next three paragraphs. This structure is a bit disjoint and I would recommend moving the opening paragraph between the second and third paragraphs (after line 85). I believe this would provide a more logical flow from general to more specific.

There are numerous references that describe various defense systems in algae, including dinoflagellates, thus it is just as likely that it is dinoflagellate's defense system that is compromised as that of the host.

Figure 4 &#8211; The image in the shaded x July 15 appears to be a different magnification than the others in the shaded series of photos. For other images, particularly in the chiseled series add small arrows to depict areas described in the text to assist reader in orienting to the particular area of interest being described. I would suggest also for the authors to investigate whether color correcting to remove some of the blue hue in these photos could help increase the contrast and clarity for the reader, since this panel of photos is relatively small. The methods do not describe the photography, but it appears that the images could have been improved with proper lighting, for these photos as well as others in the manuscript.Figure 6 &#8211; Similar comments as for Figure 4 regarding color correction. Also arrows or other notations that correspond to the text description of these images would be helpful.                 Overall the experimental design is sound, is sufficiently replicated and demonstrates three different approaches to treating Caribbean yellow-band disease and the treatment outcomes. It is also worth noting that the extended observation time was critical to the final conclusion regarding the efficacy of the chiseling method. Although a fully successful treatment was not discovered, means of treating priority, high valued coral in the field is critical for coral conservation given the current state of disease in many coral populations, which exceeds the normal carrying capacity of disease in a population and this work moves us a step forward in identifying treatments that work. Most of the methods are described in sufficient detail to evaluate their soundness and allow replication. However, this falls short in the description of the digital photography and details for the image analysis and software used. Given the photos provided in the various figures it is unclear how measurements were made to sub-centimeter accuracy. Though the text indicates photos were taken from the same angle, the scale used seems quite coarse and often at various angles in the examples provided. The distance from the subject is also important in a repeated measures design. A more thorough explanation by the authors on how they achieved the precision of the reported rates of lesion movement is important to include in the manuscript as well as any caveats. It is well known that even slight differences in angles between camera and lesion, placement of the scale or ruler and distance from the image can generate significant differences in the resulting measurements. The authors are referred to Chapter 35 of the book Diseases of Coral by Moses and Hallock. This chapter provides details of the digital photography methods and image analysis for assessing wound healing in coral. Also suggested is that the authors review the method of digital planimetry (e.g., Plos One 10(8): e0134622 and other references). For precise measurements there are specific criteria that need to be followed, it is not clear that these were used here.                 Although there is concern regarding the precision of the measurements reported, the overall findings and conclusions appear sound. There is sufficient replication of the treatments in the design and statistical analyses are sound.

It is also valuable because the model-host-pathogen selected is without hesitation among the most worrisome problems on Caribbean reefs nowadays. The paper is well-written, literature review is pertinent, hypotheses are clear as well as results. There are some minor statements which I consider to be wrong (e.g. CYBD lessons extend perpetually). While this may actually happens, it is not always like that, some times the disease arrest, progression slows down and even stops for years and in some cases the disease reactivates. Yet, I have seen colonies that might fully recover. This pattern is actually an unexplored field perhaps determined by a combination of environmental-genetic factors affecting host-pathogen interactions, resistance, susceptibility and virulence. I think this needs to be further discussed  in the manuscript. Like in many host-parasite systems, there are some host that can cope with the infection better than others, and that also applies to treatments because not all hosts respond in the same way to them. Question is why?There are other interesting findings of CYBD that are missing in the introduction that can be used for this paper. For example, Guerra et al. (2014) found that the gross (relative) chemical composition of CYBD tissues are different compared to healthy tissues.In Material and Methods, there is an assumption for selecting the treatment of shading: \"shading reduces light and the potential built up of ROS which should increase immune competence\" In my opinion this assumption is not quite well supported for CYBD. There are a couple of papers showing that immunologic responses in CYBD tissues are compromised (e.g. Mylardz et al. 2009, Montilla et al. 2016). So I do not think, that shading will improve immunological responses in this case, cause CYBD tissues have been shown to be compromised already.As for experimental design. There are some points that in my opinion deserve some discussion and in other cases some relevant considerations that need to be clarified in order to better judge the validity of the results presented here. Briefly:(1) I am happy with the application of the treatments but I am not clear with the controls that were used. Authors talked about controls, but I am not sure if these are absolute controls (i.e., diseases colonies without the treatment, no shading for instance) or procedural controls (e.g. a set of colonies with a frame similar to the one used for shading but allowing light to penetrate). For the aspiration treatment, the control would be no aspiration (untouched corals) and the procedural control the same mechanical treatment but without removing the tissue completely (i.e., vacuum off). As for the fire wall, the procedural control would be scratching the tissues without creating a deep trench in the tissue.(2) According to the results, authors did not find an effect. Given the low umber of replicates used (3 colonies), I think it is necessary to estimate the achieved statistical power. In other words, it is imperative to convince the reader that authors did not found a false negative result (i.e., retain the null hypothesis when it is wrong).Discussion and conclusions: the literature review is Ok, the discussion is focused on author's results. However, I think it is necessary to better explain the nature of controls used in the experiment (i.e., absolute or procedural) to better judge the validity of these findings.                 The paper is original and interesting. The questions are clearly stated and well supported from theoretical backgrounds, ethical standards are fulfilled, the technical quality of the paper, however, needs to be revised for more detail on methods and experimental design used needs to be presented (see below). Please explain the use of controls in the experiment. I am not sure if these are absolute controls (i.e., diseases colonies without the treatment, no shading for instance) or procedural controls (e.g. a set of colonies with a frame similar to the one used for shading but allowing light to penetrate). For the aspiration treatment, the control would be no aspiration (untouched corals) and the procedural control the same mechanical treatment but without removing the the tissue (i.e., vacuum off). As for the fire wall, the procedural control would be scratching the tissues without creating a deep trench in the tissue.                 The results are novel. Replication seem to be low, i.e., only three colonies per treatment. While this is not a problem per se, I believe that power analysis must be presented. For instance, what is the maximum achieved power given a size effect and the actual total variance? What would be the sample size that was required to achieved the power desired? It is important to show the readers that there no effects for two out of three treatments and this is not a problem of a huge type 2 error due to low replication.Conclusions will be validated if authors convince me why the lack of procedural controls like the ones used, for instance, in classic exclusion experiments whereby treatments are: cage (complete exclusion), open treatments (no cage or exclusion absolute control) and cages without cap (procedural control for the device or artifact used in the experiment).             Comments:I think this a great idea and a great paper. The literature review is very good, the way hypotheses and models supporting the hypotheses are presented is very nice. While I think sample size for each treatment is low, i celebrate the temporal component of the experiment. It is very nice to see that colonies were monitored for long time. I think this sort of papers are needed and represent an important contribution for coral disease research.My only concern is the use of controls, I think, there is a lot of manipulation in this experiment, therefore artifact controls (not only absolute controls) were needed. I would like to see and looking forward to listed author's arguments before I decide whether or not this paper can be accepted for publication.                                                ", "This is an excellent manuscript in terms of writing and editing, making it a pleasure to read! Background research on the problem studied is solid and focused; photos of the field experiment and detailed illustrations are included, and raw data are shared. However, coral scientists continue to use terminology that is inappropriate or incorrect to describe what is happening as coral tissue disappears from the skeleton in diseases. Terms and descriptions from pathology are needed. For example, the definition of \"disease progression\" is &#8220;The worsening of a disease over time&#8221; https://www.bing.com/search?q=disease+progression+definition&amp;form=EDGHPT&amp;qs=AS&amp;cvid=bef1590c7876433c9aa6a5747bff3eb1&amp;cc=US&amp;setlang=en-US. &#8220;Progression&#8221; and &#8220;advancement&#8221; have been used in papers on coral diseases when explaining the continuing loss of tissue from the skeleton, as seen in several diseases given various field-identifying names, such as white plague, white-band disease, and Caribbean yellow-band disease. However, the disease is not worsening in severity or intensity over time, just its effects, i.e., the amount of coral tissue killed at the colony margin (not &#8220;front&#8221;) has increased. \"Front\" is not being used correctly in the phrase &#8220;disease front.&#8221; &#8220;Front&#8221; refers to an orientation, as in what someone or something is facing, or faces forward or in a particular direction, or an area along the edge of something, not the edge itself. That should be changed to &#8220;tissue-loss margin.&#8221; In multiple places \"disease [or diseased] lesion\" is used. A lesion is any area of abnormal tissue and it is abnormal when it has a functional impairment of any kind, therefore it is diseased, by definition. Also, lesions do not &#8220;advance,&#8221; as in &#8220;move,&#8221; but enlarge as more cells die, lyse, and disappear from the skeleton. Finally, the term \"virulence\" is often used with \"disease,\" when virulence, which is a pathogen or microbe's ability to damage or infect a host, should refer to the pathogen (any virus, microorganism or factor, biotic or abiotic, that causes disease).  Detailed edits on necessary wording changes are provided in the general comments section.                 This manuscript reports on well-designed experiments to test hypotheses of methods that might be used to control tissue loss in CYBD-affected corals. The literature review supports the gap in knowledge and the experiments could probably be replicated based on the information provided. They were performed with high technical and ethical standards. The field permit is identified in line 130. Technique 1: Number of lesions on number of colonies treated is not provided in text (is in results figure, but could be stated in text, too).Technique 2: Supplemental Figure 1, why not put this with the main paper? In middle text box, &#8220;syphon&#8221; should be spelled &#8220;siphon&#8221; (the latter is the more common or usual spelling, at least in the US, also change it elsewhere, as in Line 167)Line 225: not exactly sure what is meant by &#8220;had reconnected with the disease lesion.&#8221; In Figure 3b, it appears that the tissue remaining outside of the chiseled groove has regained normal color and what was apparently healthy tissue at the time of the chiseling has now filled in that groove to reconnect with the formerly diseased tissue. So, may be best to write &#8220;had filled in the chiseled groove and reconnected to the formerly diseased tissue&#8221;?                 The findings are consistent with the methods used and the resulting data obtained. The discussion is well done, except for including a paper that is not relevant. The supporting literature is otherwise appropriate and the conclusions are valid, with good suggestions for future research and application of tissue loss control techniques for diseased corals. The conclusions are well stated, cover the original research question, and limited in scope to supporting the results.

In personal communication with B. Riegl, this reviewer learned that the &#8220;yellow band&#8221; was more like the fine filaments seen in black-band disease (BBD), but brightly yellow, and that yellow particles remained on the recently denuded skeleton after the tissue disappeared. A large pile of mined elemental sulfur was onshore near this site. Because the microbial consortium in BBD includes all the members of the sulfur cycle, including Beggiatoa spp. that excrete particles of elemental sulfur on the surface of their filamentous cells, what might have happened is that sulfur from the pile had run off or blown into the seawater there and black-band microbes had been metabolizing the excess sulfur. Unfortunately, no other studies were done on these affected corals, including microbiological or histological evaluations, so we cannot be sure. However, this reviewer suggests deleting this reference, because it is not at all related to CYBD, and that rate of tissue loss was similar to what occurs in BBD, another clue to its identification.Line 362: delete &#8220;also&#8221;Line 363: change &#8220;progression&#8221; to &#8220;tissue loss&#8221;Line 368: change&#8220;progression&#8221; to &#8220;tissue loss&#8221;Lines 369 and 371: change &#8220;progression&#8221; to &#8220;tissue-loss&#8221;Line 372: change &#8220;CYBD progresses&#8221; to &#8220;CYBD tissue loss is&#8221;Line 373: &#8220;virulence of CYBD&#8221; is not correct.

But, this could be a matter of style.In general, there is an excessive use of ambiguous pronouns to start sentences. Using words like 'it', 'these', 'they', and so on decreases comprehension by the reader. Ambiguous pronouns are used abundantly throughout the MS and I strongly suggest that the authors edit their MS to specifically remove these words, especially when they are used in the begining of a sentence.Lines 103-108: In this final paragraph of the introduction, the authors outline what they did. It would be nice to follow those enumerated sentences with a few sentences about what they found. What are the main take-aways?Line 117: \"which are major taxonomic groups in the zooplankton\".

The question is extremely well posed and is relevant. The authors used a simulation-approach to tackle the question and the simulation design is very good to me. Notably, the set of parameters is well defined and well argumented. My only worry concern the use of a single founding individual (although other scenarios are simulated); to me authors should justify it better, and/or include further results for other scenarios. For instance, authors could easily confront results from 1 vs. 20 founder for some figures to clearly show what the impact of increasing the number of founders is. They argue that 1 founder is a likely scenario for instance for glacial lakes, but there are many other scenarios where I guess 20 founders is also likely.

I have not corrected every mistake - see General comments below for some examples - but I also recommend that you get a native English speaker to read through your manuscript before resubmitting. I also think that the structure of the discussion is quite poor. It rather hops from one topic to the next at the moment. Consider why people might refer to your paper - I would have thought that on this global scale, readers might seek your paper to understand what is happening in a certain region of the world. A more appropriate structure therefore, might be to look at each region in its own section of the discussion, and to consider the risk facing the as yet unaffected neighbouring countries.In terms of figures, while you refer to figures 3 and 4 in the results section, there did not seem to be much reference to the findings in the discussion. If these results are not that interesting, they should not be included. Figure 4 is not a very good figure because the information could more easily be understood if the raw data were shown - a good graphic should simplify data, not make it more difficult to comprehend. I also think that figure 5 would be better represented as a table, with countries listed and ticks added for the ways the ladybird has entered the country.I question the usefulness of Table 1. This is not the kind of table a reader is drawn to looking at. This information could be in the main text.While the manuscript is \"self-contained\" and has results that match up to the research question, I think that some more reference has to be made to the Roy et al paper in the discussion. You and they have produced similar types of map, but how does yours differ? Does it add any new information? It appears to, so why not make more of that?                 I think your research question is slightly vague and broad and could be improved. For example, you do not go into detail about the insights you seek from entomologists, nor what these insights might help with. In addition, your rationale seems to be to raise awareness of the importance of selecting biocontrol agents carefully. However, surely this awareness raising has been going on for at least two decades? See any text book on biological control, or papers such as the two listed below, or any by authors that have done much in the area such as Mark Hoddle, and you will find guidelines for selecting appropriate biological control agents, because we now know that selecting the wrong ones has deleterious effects. I think therefore, that this should not be you main reason for this study. Also on this point, you need to emphasise WHEN the harlequin ladybird was introduced to the different countries. I would be surprised if it was a recent biological control agent introduced to a new country, given the lessons we have learnt countless times over. This important context is missing throughout the paper.Refs:Julien M.H., J.K. Scott, W. Orapa, and Q. Paynter. 2007. History, opportunities and challenges for biological control in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. Crop Protection 26: 255-265.Messing R.H. and M.G. Wright. 2006. Biological Control of invasive species: solution or pollution? Frontiers in Ecology and Environment 4: 132-140I also have a problem with how you have reported some of your results. In the discussion, you make statements based on the responses to your survey, but ideally these statements should be corroborated with other evidence. How can we trust the statements? Are they made by lab technicians or professors? Are the backed up or refuted by other evidence? Where you are going to include some statement from your surveys, like \"the Harlequin ladybird is the most dominant ladybird in Switzerland\", you need to either back it up with facts, or state clearly that it is someone's opinion (preferably a named person).                 I think the findings are valid - you have found some countries where the ladybird is present where Roy et al. said it was absent, and you have spoken to some people about their take on the matter, highlighting how unaffected countries might be need stricter controls to prevent invasion. However, I think the way it is framed could be better. As mentioned above, if you could include and emphasise the timing aspect and cross-reference that with the mechanism by which these things have invaded, that would provide some more context. Then if you could turn the discussion round to make it more about highlighting which unaffected countries might be most at risk and how and what they should do about it, that would make a more interesting read, if not a more informative one.             Comments:Overall, it seems like this qualitative approach has taken a lot of work and has been a useful exercise in updating a distribution map without actually doing any of the expensive fieldwork, but I think that to turn it into a useful story, the manuscript needs a better angle. It needs a stronger rationale and research question in the introduction and the discussion needs to be more useful to practitioners. Academics requiring greater depth can, and will, use the Roy et al. paper, but to make this contribution useful, I think you should use either the alternative angle above or another angle that seems more fitting to you.Specific comments below:Abstract: L23 - biocontrol agents do not eradicate pests, they regulate them.L24-25 is poorly worded - try something like  \"However, the biocontrol agents can themselves become invasive species under certain conditions\"L30 instead of saying 19 scientists, insert the percentage here. The reader has no way of knowing if 19 is a high or low numberIntroductionL44-46 is poorly written. What about: \"Biological control is a pest management strategy whereby the natural enemies of a target species are introduced or cultivated to help suppress populations. The target pests are often those that have important negative impacts on crop production, human health or biodiversity...\"L49 - nevertheless is the wrong word. I think you mean \"however\".

Also, was any information recorded about the level of scientist the respondent was? Lab Tech, Post doc, Professor etc? Could that have impacted the results or the validity of their answers?I think the discussion should include some kind of critique of your methods. Was your sampling method suitable? Were you questions approrpriate? How could it have been done better?L141 A lot of the information here should be in the caption for the map or self explanatory from the map legend. Besides, the map should be in the results section.L153 -155 - this does not make sense to me. What do you mean by appreciated?ResultsL159 More details are needed for this section. How many articles did you find? What years were they from? What countries, journals etc were they from? How did they contribute to the map? Have a look at other metanalysis type papers to see what to present here.Were there any conflicting reports from the scientists responses or did everyone agree?Discussion L204 -206 - you need to explain this a bit moreL227 Here is an example of where your reporting of results gets a bit messy. You state here that the Harlequin ladybird is the most abundant species of Coccinellid in Switzerland. Normally, this would be backed up with evidence like a cited paper. You cite Table 1 which is a list of responses from unknown scientists. How can we be sure of this \"fact\"? Can you back it up with references? Can you cite the person's name as a personal communication? If not, you need to be very clear that this is opinion and not scientific fact.You could also make reference to any guidlines now in place for selecting and introducing a biocontrol agent, for dealing with the Harlequin ladybird once it has invaded, and/or for preventing it entering/invading.                                                ", "In their review, Camacho-Cervantes et al., presented an overview of the current Harmonia axyridis worldwide distribution. By reviewing 600 scientific articles found using ISI Web of Science search engine, and by surveys&#8217; results answered by 74 scientists working on Coccinellidae around the world, Camacho-Cervantes et al., were able to achieve their first objective (to document the non-native range of Harlequin ladybird). The current review also highlights the importance of understanding the potential expansion of the introduced biocontrol agents&#8217; distributional range, which might impact native communities even if local policies don&#8217;t allow the introduction of exotic species. However, potential biases might appear in trying to quantify this change in distributional ranges by only using surveys. Although the authors acknowledge the limitations of such an approach between lines 114 and 117, the discussion section should also address it; therefore, the conclusions about the origin of current distributional ranges are not too bold.                 No experimental design needed. This review has sought their data using ISI Web of Science search engine. No statistics were applied or needed in order to answer the questions stated at the end of the introduction.                 Overall, the article is well written, with minor grammatical suggestions included as &#8220;general comments to the authors&#8221;. I recommend the publication of this article, as the results it presents contribute to enhancing our awareness about releasing biocontrol agents outside their native distributional ranges, without an understanding of the impacts of such a strategy on native food webs. Recently, Gonz&#225;lez-Chang et al., (2016) pointed out some issues related to this approach regarding perceiving arthropod interactions as a &#8220;food chain&#8221;, instead of being interacting in a &#8220;food web&#8221;. However, despite the strengths of their review, the authors need to clarify the concept of &#8220;Biocontrol&#8221; used in their manuscript, which in my understanding is referring to &#8220;Biological Control&#8221;. The authors mentioned several times to the non-target effects and environmental risks of a &#8220;Biocontrol&#8221; approach. Louda et al., (2003), compiled several cases where a &#8220;Classical Biological Control&#8221; approach was used to control weeds and arthropods, generating non-target effects on local biodiversity. Conversely, &#8220;Conservation Biological Control&#8221; can also be understood as a strategy that promotes &#8220;Biocontrol&#8221;, and not necessarily poses a threat to local biodiversity or to increasing environmental risks. When managed accordingly, conservation biological control strategies can enhance biodiversity (Gurr et al., 2017), and thus promoting several ecosystem services (Wratten et al., 2012). Therefore, a clarification needs to be added to the current manuscript, as different biological control strategies exist.             Comments:Suggested literatureGonz&#225;lez-Chang, M., Wratten, S.
