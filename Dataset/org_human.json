After using the abrasive under the same weight and shot blasting time, it is easy to understand that sample 2 has more oxides retained due to thicker oxide scale.

In Fig. 6, please use the same magnification in the images for a clear comparison.

Please also indicate the exact zones in Figs. 7A and 8A for an enlarged observation in Figs. 7B and 8B, respectively.\r\n7.

", "Overall, this is an interesting inquiry into steel oxidation, how storage time affects the structural evolution of the oxide scale, and how the structure impacts the optimal descaling approach. It needs significantly more detail in the methods to support its conclusions, and perhaps some additional thought on whether observations are attributable to composition or morphology.\n\r\nLanguage use is decent. Needs some work in a few areas, see general comments section for specifics. Title should be reorganized, if possible, for readability and clarity \u2013 I recommend \u201cEffect of oxide scale structure on shot-blasting of hot-rolled strip steel.\u201d\n\r\nThe introduction needs a little bit of readability work; but the literature cited seems relevant and the establishment of the background \u2013 oxide scaling approaches and their uses and limitations \u2013 is strong and provides good detail. In several places the authors say that \u201cresearch is not sufficient\u201d on particular topics. It would strengthen the paper to explain how this insufficiency impacts productivity, and/or how this insufficiency will be addressed by the present research.\n\r\nMost figures are of acceptable quality. Interpretation and results could be improved through the inclusion of some additional data, specific recommendations below. Scale bars are included on all images. I believe there is a repeated typographical error in Figure 1, I recommend the authors carefully review figures and tables to catch any other such errors. I would like to see significantly more detail on SEM and XRD settings either in the captions or in the main body of the text, as well as details on sample preparation. The omission of these elements considerably weakens the conclusions \u2013 see section 3 of this review. The introduction could do a better job of framing the research question. It was clear by the end of the paper what the question was, but I would have liked a clearer picture at the outset of why the \u201cstorage time\u201d or \u201cair-cooling time\u201d is relevant in the broader scope of steel oxide layer removal. Would it be better for the authors\u2019 stated goals of efficiency and lowering emissions to have a short storage time or a long one, perhaps considering the manufacturing and supply chain? More discussion on this topic would help frame the purpose of the paper for the reader.\n\r\nMy concerns about rigor and detail are constrained to the analytical methods and sample preparation, which I will cover in detail in the following sections.\n\r\nReplication of these findings will be difficult without additional information on the samples themselves as well as the analysis methods. A thermal history of the steel samples during hot-rolling would help. This is partially addressed in the introduction, but never fully explained. A simple figure showing representative dwell temperature vs. time for Q235 during the hot-rolling process would make the article more accessible to the general materials science audience, not just those versed in steel manufacturing. My main concerns with this paper have to do with the robustness and controlled nature of the data presented. I believe the data is legitimate and supports the authors\u2019 conclusions (with some exceptions, see Section 4), but because these conclusions depend purely on interpretation of SEM images and XRD phase IDs, much more background is needed.

Combining this figure with some of the later cross-sectional analysis may also help readability.\n\r\nFigure 4. In addition to the general notes from section 3: the y-axis should be in English, I am assuming this is \u201cIntensity (counts)\u201d or similar. The data could use a background correction, as there is some scattering contributing to the background in the 10-30 2\u03b8 region. Additionally, there are some phase-identification discrepancies that would be resolved by the inclusion of the literature patterns \u2013 with ICDD or COD card catalog numbers \u2013 on the figure itself. This typically requires reproduction in color, so alternative presentations may be necessary if color is not available.\r\n\tPeak ID inconsistencies that need correction:\r\n\uf0a7\t30\u00b0 2\u03b8 \u2013 M, O, or both?\r\n\uf0a7\t38\u00b0 2\u03b8 \u2013 M or O?\r\n\uf0a7\t58\u00b0 2\u03b8 \u2013 M, O, or both?\r\n\uf0a7\t90\u00b0 2\u03b8 \u2013 M or I?\r\nThe primary issue with this figure is the claimed ID of a F3O4/Fe phase. The data as presented show that the authors have observed an Fe phase (having a tight correlation with Q235 literature patterns) and a magnetite (Fe3O4) phase in both samples. However, in order to identify a eutectoid (i.e. a solid solution of two phases) more careful analysis of peak shifts and peak intensities would have to be performed, as the interatomic distances should change as a result of varying Fe inclusion, compared to the parent phases. For the record, I do not believe that the presence or non-presence of the eutectoid phase is necessary to explain the differences in behavior of the oxide scale, so references to this phase could be removed, the inconsistencies above could be corrected, and the data could be presented as-is.\r\nThe important difference I do see is that Figure 4B shows a higher percentage of the Fe phase, but without further explanation of the samples\u2019 preparation and mounting, there is no way to tell that the variance in the Fe phase is not simply due to variation arising from the presumed pulverization/grinding process, or possibly due to the thicker deposit of oxides (i.e. higher mass fraction) in the No. 2 group. Inclusion and discussion of the sample preparation would strengthen the central claims about the different oxidation times requiring different descaling methods.\n\r\nFigure 5. This figure could be improved by adding a reference surface, i.e. before blasting.\n\r\nFigure 6. This figure could be combined with Figure 5, so that the surface and cross-sectional views are next to each other. The claims about No.2/6B having \u201cbetter combination with the basal body\u201d in line 199 could use additional support, this does not seem obvious to me from the image. An alternate theory could simply be that the No.1 film is more cohesive and densified, therefore when shot-blasted, it comes off in larger flakes rather than being crushed into smaller pieces. A higher magnification image or, better, a compositional BSE image showing a density gradient in this zone might provide evidence of this \u201cbetter combination\u201d claim. HRTEM would provide conclusive proof, but these experiments are difficult and lengthy.\n\r\nFigure 7. Additional notes about the imaging modes are needed \u2013 7A is clearly a compositional BSE image but 7B may be topographical BSE, or even SEI. SEM firing parameters and working distance are needed to allow for replication.\n\r\nFigure 8. The claim about \u201ccolor uniformity\u201d on lines 213-214 is only true if this is a compositional BSE image. Please specify, the contrast variations at edges indicate that these are SE images, which carry no information about composition. Additionally, if these are compositional BSE images, these contrast variations will need to be addressed in the text.\n\r\nFigures 9-12. I would recommend combining these for direct comparison \u2013 figures 9 and 11 can be combined so that they can be compared side-by-side. Same with 10 and 12. The imaging parameters included in figures 10/12 should be included for other images in the manuscript, though usually these are in the caption or the Experimental Method section. The data would also be stronger if EDS mapping of Fe for these regions were included. Also \u2013 figure 9/11 does a better job (but still not entirely conclusive) demonstrating the \u201cbetter combination\u201d claim from Figure 6. This is the type of magnification needed, preferably with before-and-after images.\n\r\nTable 1. How was the chemical composition determined?\n\r\nTable 2. How was position in the sample determined?

Layering should be clear from the cross-sectional SEM in Figure 3, but it simply looks disorganized and poorly densified. I think this is the real conclusion from the data \u2013 somewhat counterintuitively, well-formed, highly dense oxide scales are easier to shatter and remove under shot-blasting.\r\nLine 225 \u2013 don\u2019t state that results are accidental.

I am not sure this is what the authors intend. ", "I felt that the written structure of the article generally followed acceptable practice The abstract suggested that the properties of the scale would explain the effectiveness of the descaling process.  \n\r\nI was disappointed by the very limited experimental design of the investigation which only looked at two aging conditions of the steel and its surface scale which was 1) no aging and 2) aging at ambient after one year.  I cannot believe that manufacturers or consumers would want to wait for a year to be able to effectively descale these materials so that they could avoid various other methods including pickling.  \n\r\nThis work did not directly compare shot blasting and pickling to show the difference.  In the methods section, the experimental equipment was described where the process parameters were detailed to include 1) angle of impingement, 2) velocity, 3) shot diameter and 4) amount of shot used.  Only the last variable was apparently used, and no other attempt was done to determine it other factors might have contributed to the success of the investigation.  There was no optimization of the process claimed in the conclusions because there were no other factors that were tested.  There was only one type of shot blasting material used. I was looking forward to see the properties of the scale explained by the morphology and chemical composition, however it did not go far enough.  Only the average chemical composition of the scale was used as a characterization.  The Fe / O phase diagram was referred to in the quoted references, but was not discussed in enough detail to establish what was expected in the present investigation.  Obviously the scale present in fresh material was not in equilibrium, and it was implied that material stored for a year was nearly in equilibrium.  If it was important to the success of the investigation to produce the equilibrium phase and distribution, why then was no attempt made to accelerate the formation of the equilibrium product?\n\r\nWhile the morphology was shown in layer thickness, there was no quantitative expression of grain size or other distribution of the phases present.  No attempt was made to assess the mechanism of adhesion or bonding or the strength of the adhesion of the scale layers to help explain the observed behavior.  I would imagine that a micro shear test or bend tests as described for tension descaling would be appropriate methods to derive the properties of the scale needed for this characterization.\n\r\nThe introduction reviewed an extensive list of competing descaling processes used in the industry compared to shot blasting, but no attempt was made to make an assessment of the relative cost, material aging or logistical tradeoffs between these methods.  There was also no pass / fail criteria expressed to help judge the ultimate success of failure of the results.

Sources for the standard procedure should be cited. What role does reaction time play? What specific method for preparing thienylmagnesium chlorides was used in this work? How much lower is the observed surface coverage if an excess of isopropylmagnesium chloride is used? Because the substrates are immersed into a solution of the Grignard reagent, presumably the concentration of thienylmagnesium chloride is much larger than the concentration of surface-bound aryl halides regardless of the preparation method used. Is the implication that the excess isopropylmagnesium chloride can also react with the surface-bound aryl halides?

The experiments are mostly well-designed, but the absence of any characterization data for the key molecule, 4-iodobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate, is very concerning. Basic characterization data should be included.\n\r\nAdditionally, there are several points where control experiments would be useful for supporting the conclusions:\r\n\t* Line 121: \"XPS of the spontaneously grafted film is consistent with a thin layer of C sp2 atoms with some adventitious carbon, including residual carbonate from oxidative cleaning at 288.5 eV.\" - XPS of the substrate after cleaning but before grafting would be useful to confirm the source of the sp2 C signal. (Also, Figure 4c should be be referred to here.)\r\n\t* Lines 134-136: It is not clear that using trimethoxysilane grafting to an ITO surface should be directly comparable to benzenediazonium salt coupling to a gold surface. Is there any literature to support the idea that they should have comparable levels of surface coverage? There are also likely to be differences in efficacy of coupling to in iodophenyl surface (diazonium/Au system) vs a bromophenyl surface (silane/ITO system). Controls with a bromophenyldiazonium salt/Au surface and/or with an appropriate iodophenyl thiol/Au surface would be more likely to reveal more about these systems.\r\n\t* Line 195: XPS (or other analysis of the film) after sonication and chloroform extraction would confirm that the film remained intact after the particle removal process.\n\r\nLine 263: The \"rigorous cleaning\" procedure is described here to be extraction with boiling chloroform, but in the main text (Lines 194-195), the procedure is described as including both sonication in acetone and chloroform extraction. The presentation of the findings is generally reasonable, but it leaves open a number of questions: \r\n* Line 114: \"thickness of the thin film of 2.5 nm, consistent with other reported spontaneously grafted films.\" A monolayer of iodophenyl groups should be much thinner than 2.5 nm (< 1 nm)--can the author comment on the accuracy of this value and what it implies about surface coverage if it is accurate? References should be cited here for other reported films.\r\n* Lines 115-116: The measured 1:8 I/C ratio is significantly lower than the expected 1:5 ratio (implying that only 62.5% of phenyl rings still have an iodine that can participate in grafting reactions). Can the authors comment on what this would imply about potential surface coverage?\r\n* The studies with the ferrocene probe are used to suggest the formation of a closely packed monolayer--how does this finding relate to the later conclusions about polymer surface coverage?\r\n* Line 159: How were sample colors determined and compared? Can the color change be influenced by the gold surface? Citing absorption spectra here would be helpful and more quantitative.\r\n* Lines 179-182: \"A reasonable explanation for these...features is that they were formed from Pd(O) catalyst centers that were physisorbed onto the substrate surface\" -- If this is true, then it should also happen in the ferrocene studies--what effect would excess Pd catalyst have on the surface coverage studies? Could physisorbed catalyst react with thienylmagnesium chloride and/or thienyl bromide to either give detectable solution species or excess surface-bound ferrocene?\r\n* Lines 183-185: \"[upon precipitation] the active catalyst site was inaccessible and polymerization effectively ceased.\" -- Is this necessarily true? This would depend upon the porosity of the particles formed upon polymer precipitation, the location of catalyst sites (particle interior vs particle surface), and solubility of monomer in polymer particle. The intended initiation sites are also bound to an insoluble material (the gold substrate), so it is difficult to argue that polymerization will occur from the gold surface and not from a polymer particle.\r\n* Lines 187-188: \"the brush thickness on the 2D surface is close to the particle radius, implying that the features may have grown as part of the same process.\" -- It is not clear why this would be true. By the authors' arguments, the thickness of the brush should depend upon polymer growth rate, while the particle size should depend upon whatever stage of agglomeration the precipitating solution polymer chains (which can grow from both ends and should have a different degree of polymerization than the surface bound chains) achieve by the time they adsorb to the substrate--these seem to be two very different factors.\r\n* Lines 196-198: \"...microscopy of the substrate...reveals a roughly 1 micron thick, regular film of polythiophene...\" -- If the assumption is that each surface-bound aryl iodide results in one polymer chain and that there is a high density of aryl iodide sites, does a thickness of 1 micron fit with accessible molecular weights for polythiophene prepared by Pd catalysts? My instinct is that preparing polythiophene chains with a chain length of around 1 micron would mean reaching much higher molecular weights than can typically be prepared by these methods.\r\n* Line 232: The yield for the key molecule 4-iodobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate is described as \"0.090 g, 28%\", but 0.090 g of the product (317.82 g/mol) corresponds to 0.283 mmol of product, which, starting from 2.5 mmol of 4-iodoaniline, seems to correspond to an 11.3% yield. The absence of any additional characterization data is concerning. This manuscript describes some potentially interesting results, but there is significant room for improvement in the interpretation and presentation of the results. All of the areas of concern seem addressable if the authors are allowed sufficient time for revisions. ", "The paper is well written and well referenced. Figures and table are good. The experimental design is presented in detailed procedures. Methods are described in detail and information will be easy to replicate. The findings are supported by experimental evidence. This manuscript reports the synthesis of polythiophene films by surface-initiated Kumada cross-coupling polymerization. The experimental methods are well described and the analysis of the polymer film by SEM is proper because it allows the determination of the film thickness. I appreciate the originality of the reported work but I do not see much potential in terms of potential applications. By using non-substituted thiophene as the monomer, there is no regioregularity problem. \n\r\nThe authors should determine the optical bang gap from the UV-vis spectrum of the film shown in Figure 7. From the manuscript, it is not clear if the polythiophene film thickness can be controlled. The authors should discuss if the film thickness can be controlled because this is very useful.\n\r\nThe authors could try to adjust the method to grow the polythiophene film on transparent ITO which will allow the characterization of the film to determine optical and electronic properties. The molecular weight of the polythiophene cannot be determined because non-substituted polythiophene is insoluble in organic solvents. I would see a lot more value to this work if 3-hexylthiophene would be used as the starting monomer to generate P3HT. This would also allow a discussion of regioregularity.\n\r\nThe authors recognize the formation of polymer in solution which is physisorbed on the surface of the film. The authors should try to analyze the films using TMAFM analysis to determine the rms. The morphology of the film is important, and TMAFM analysis would give some answers regarding the surface morphology of the polythiophene films.\n\r\nThe authors could try  to measure the conductivity of the film upon doping with iodine using a four point probe.

Still, one example of a ketimine is presented. In my opinion, the reaction concept is well known as previously published by several authors (J. Org.

I have several observations that justify why the manuscript cannot be accepted for publication on PeerJ Journal at this moment. Please, see the following points.\r\n1)\tI did not fully understand from the Table 1 and 2 why Amberlyst-15 was chosen as the optimal catalyst. Overall yields of 3a in the case of acid alumina, M K-10, molecular sieves, and anhydrous MgSO4 were higher.\r\n2)\tFor me, the section \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d is poor, and it is limited to aryl aldehydes and few amines.\r\n3)\tGeneral Procedure: The purification method needs to be better elucidated.

In this study, the authors reported 53 phytochemical compounds, 18 have previously identified with some biological activity.

Therefore, I recommend this manuscript for publication in PeerJ Organic Chemistry after consideration of the issues and corrections.\n\r\n1) The whole manuscript is clearly written in professional, unambiguous language. The introduction section is full of information about the phytochemical compounds, however, I think you should do an update in some references as at lines 37-43, to show the topic is more current.

In this Tables (6 and 7) you should exclude the Similarity (%) and RT (min) columns, they are a duplicate information. 1) Some studies in current literature report the use of LC-MS\u2013MS to identification and characterization of components in plant extracts. With this kind of Cactaceae plant, could the authors use this technique? Or is the GC-MS the most appropriate for this situation?\n\r\n2) The method was described with sufficient detail and information to replicate. However, the authors need to correct some abbreviations of the solvents. Methanol is correctly represented as MeOH, not MeOTH. Still, acetone isn\u2019t CH\u2083CH\u2083, this is ethane molecule. The correct acetone representation is (CH3)2CO. \n\r\n3) In some point of the manuscript (line 159, 172 and go on) the authors starting described the phytochemical constituents from the CH3CN extract. Is this information correct? The use of acetonitrile wasn\u2019t described in the Materials and Methods section. 1) Only the compounds and their respective activities were reported in the Discussion section, and the obtained results support the medicinal use of this plant in traditional medicine. However, the authors should explore more the importance of why find out what kind of phytochemical compounds are present in O. megarrhiza. For example, you should discuss about a future developing of new drugs, new chemical studies, or about the encouragement of planting this species once this one is listed as endangered in the Red List of the IUCN.\n\r\n2) In the line 198 the authors described the \u201cthe presence of 18 phytochemical compounds with biological activities, with similarity values of identification above 93%.\u201d Considering the tables 1-4, there are only 15 phytochemical compounds with similarity values of identification above 93%.

The authors used organic solvents to prepare the extracts and 53 phytochemical compounds were identified. The protocol used in the chemical characterization agrees with literature procedures. However, the text is not clear and need to an extensive revision for types. The quality of figures and chemical structures also need to be improved. After reading of the manuscript, it is possible to identify a confusion in the nomenclature/abbreviation of the solvents used to prepare the extracts, which makes it difficult to understand the text. This work could be a relevant contribution for Chemistry of Natural Products, but I don\u2019t recommend the acceptance of this manuscript in Peer J. this way. I suggest a careful review of the text and addition of a biological application study for the extracts before a new submission. The research agrees with the Scope of the journal. However, in some cases the methods are not described with sufficient details or information to replicate. I suggest a detail review. The results obtained are promising. However, they need to be better discussed. I suggest adding another reference parameter to complete the characterization of the compounds present in the extracts since the similarity of the spectra in many cases is less than 75%.

", "While the work is interesting and relevant regarding the phytochemical analysis of Opuntia megarrhiza, I have some concerns about the manuscript that make me not to recommend publication in its current form. Thus, it needs major revisions before publication, including English language improvement. In my opinion, the main concern is the tentative identification of the extracted phytochemicals based only on the similarity approach from the Mass Spectral Libraries. Although the libraries are an important tool to help in the identification, additionally analysis should be used. At least, I recommend a Linear retention index analysis and comparison with standard samples. The authors mention that the extracts were filtered using two different membrane filter (PTFE and PVDF) and as consequence, the chemical composition of the extracts are different. Thus, the authors should clarify the difference between both membranes and discuss the results regarding the composition. \n\r\nRegarding the chromatograms showed in the Figure 2, some of the labeled peaks are nearly in the noise, which difficult the appropriated identification of the phytochemicals. \r\nI also suggest improving the discussion comparing the identified compounds and the identified compounds reported in other studies for the Opuntia Species\n\r\nThe authors reposted that a\u201d exhaustive search\u201d was made for the biological activity based in the literature. But, if possible, a small biological activity screening against bacteria or fungi will considerably improve the study. As suggestion too, due to the large number of cited references in the manuscript (more the 100 references) a revision manuscript about the phytochemical composition and biological activity from Opuntia Species could be organized. Some minor revision to improve the manuscript are suggested as follow:\r\nMass analysis is a spectrometric technique and not a \u201dSpectrophotometry\u201d technique.

However, some aspects could be improved, making the article accessible to a broader scientific audience:\n\r\n1) Figure 1 would benefit from including the explanation of abbreviations, and the meaning of colors used for the products (not all cultural backgrounds see red as unfavorable and green as positive). Also, I would suggest not using a combination of red and green concerning the colorblind readers.\n\r\n2) Since the estimates with RMSD-PP method are critical in the screening stage of the workflow, it would be helpful to have a short, 1-2 sentences, explanation of its principle with its first mention.\n\r\n3) On lines 142-143, adding info on the fact that the estimates come from RMSD-PP would make the distinctions between the estimates and the actual semi-empirical barriers easier.\n\r\n4) Figure 9 would report the reaction path in a more comprehensive way when supplemented by data on reaction energies as well as barriers.\n\r\n5) Figure S2 is missing the caption. The dataset used is rather extensive, given the methodology used, and the extension towards also evaluating bimolecular reactions with meta-MD is valuable. Although, the description of the experimental procedures could be enhanced by providing more details on the following two issues:\n\r\n1) on line 63, the authors provide an additional set of hyper-parameters used for meat-MD, which were found as in this study. However, there is no data on how were these parameters found, what other sets were used etc.\n\r\n2) on line 77, the algorithm checks for changes in atomic connectivity every 5 ps. How is this performed? Do such checks rely on semi-empirical energy minimization as described on line 74? I wonder if the authors have tried more meta-MD runs, in particular, for bimolecular reactions where the odds of enumerating all expected low-barrier reactions are relatively low. Given the computational costs, it should be feasible to markedly increase the number of runs at least for some of the problematic cases. ", "Overall, the manuscript is well-written.

The adjustments include mainly adjusting the parameters of the RMSD potential, but all cross-usage of different products in the metadynamics simulation.\r\nThe results in this manuscript are of large interest to the computational chemistry community, as automated search for transition states is a, yet, unsolved problem. The presented approach will thus be of significance in automated determinations of reaction barriers that are used microkinetic modeling.

"], "pchem-21": ["This submission deals with the adsorption of lead from water onto a biosorbent based on peanut shells. Some equilibrium batch tests were conducted and conventional models were applied to the data. The approach applied is very conventional and the only new aspect is the use of a relatively new biosorbent for a specific contaminant. I think that it is a normal approach in a laboratory to evaluate a commercial product and to propose it for the treatment of a specific type of water. There are many studies and textbooks giving detailed research and insights about the experimental evaluation of adsorbents. I don\u2019t see any advancement in the science in this aspects. \r\nIt can further not be excluded that such a waste product may have the potential to contaminate the treated water because of pesticides or other heavy metals used in various part of the world.\r\nBecause of its low informative value and no innovative approaches proposed, I have to recommend to reject the submission. -\tLine 125: in this research a synthetic wastewater was used, based on a very simple composition by the dilution Pb in distilled water.

If, as the authors suggest, the tested material should be useful for contaminant removal from wastewaters etc. why were no tests carried out on such waters? This would be highly necessary because in real/ natural waters, competition for adsorption sites occurs, reducing the available adsorption capacities for single adsorbates by orders of magnitude. \r\n-\tWith the extremely high dosages reported here (for instance see figure 4 with 25-100 mg/L), it appears largely unrealistic that the tested material could be applied in practice.

The values were reversed. ", "The manuscript deals with the very serious problem of aqueous systems contamination by lead, a very toxic and hazardous contaminant. The solution investigated to obtain pure and safe water for drinking is based on the adsorption performance of a peanuts shell biosorbent. \r\nIn the latest years many papers, aiming at finding an efficient, economically feasible and environment-friendly adsorbent, have been published, the most of them addressed to claim very high adsorption capacity. Less attention was addressed to verify the performance of such adsorbents in flow systems based on adsorption packed columns for contaminated water remediation.\r\nThe authors claim that main goal of the study was to assess the biosorption potential of peanut shells wastes (PSB) to remove Pb from wastewater through experimental and modeling approaches, using batch and flow systems, operated under various conditions in terms of adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dosage, solution pH and contact time. A comparison with a commercial compost biosorbent (CSB) was also performed. Experimental characterization of PSB has been carried out through FTIR, SEM, and nitrogen adsorption for surface area/pore volume size. \r\nReally, the results obtained in the latter case (surface area of 226.8 m2 /g, average particle and pore size 26.5 and 3.3 nm, respectively, 5.11% porosity) are not presented as adsorption isotherms, while they are essential to support the reported, rather surprising, size values. The work is medium quality, and could be improved by adding some results, discussion, especially concerning the potential application, following the below suggestions.\r\nConcerning the adsorption equilibrium measurements and modeling:\r\nline 404\u2026\u2026 \u201cThe removal onto PSB increased from 49.4 to 73.0 % when the contact time was changed from 15 to 60 min. Moreover, only 6.8% removal was increased when the contact time further increased from 60 to 180 min\u201d\r\nComments : If the purpose is to determine the real equilibrium values, further 6.8 % increase of adsorbed amount is not negligible. The approach to the equilibrium can be very slow, especially in the experiments in which the amount of lead is not enough excess with respect the amount of adsorbent, resulting in a rather high reduction of lead concentration and then driving force to adsorption. Moreover, I suggest that the Authors  don\u2019t use the term contact time along all the manuscript to indicate the run time. The modeling approach is acceptable; the same for choosing R2= 0.99 as acceptable values for supporting a model.\r\nConcerning the flow column experiments and modeling :\r\nI believe an introduction to the comments is necessary. The challenge of using adsorption to remove Pb from wastewater containing 10-100 ppm and over is really very much arduous, if one considers that the current limit for drinking water is 10 ppb. This means that you need a very large amount of very high capacity adsorbent or a very large scale adsorption column. Cheap adsorbent can surely help, but how much the adsorbent cost influences the final cost of the treatment ? And, looking at the above premise, how frequent is the necessity of column regeneration ? How much the operation influences the final cost, compared to the effect of adsorbent cost ? Moreover, the discussion and interpretation of the breakthrough curve sas depending of the operating parameters should be less qualitative.\r\nComing back to the right comment of the Authors on the low attention addressed in the most papers to verify the performance of adsorbents in flow systems, however their experimental approach is rather far from answering the above considerations. First of all, the scale of the experiments : the column is too small and the adsorbent bed geometry is questionable. A too large diameter with respect the height also results in a radial profile of velocity very non uniform, and the entrance effects are critical.\r\nFrom the experimental data it can be seen that to reach the limit of 50 ppb (higher than the current regulation limit) 99.8 or 99.9 % removal are the values fot the breakthrough curves to be stopped. One simple parameter to be evaluated is the corresponding BV (bed volume) number at that value, i.e. the ratio between the total amount of liquid fed to the bed and the adsorbent volume. Few BVs means a very high frequency of regeneration, resulting in high operation cost.   \r\nOne more aspect, the importance of regeneration, underlined by the Authors, is not investigated. The comparison with CCB is winning in terms of adsorption capacity and shape of breakthrough curves, however the flow column behavior of CCB is very poor. It seems difficult to imagine the practical utilization of CCB for lead sequestration in a flow system on the base of the results found by the Authors.\r\nEnglish language is of acceptable quality.

The GitHub link is broken: https://github.com/jensengroup/dha should be https://github.com/jensengroup/dha_htvs\n\r\n2. It is a bit confusing that compound 9 in Table 3 and compound 10 in Table 4 have storage energies and reaction barriers that are not comparable. As I understand it, the properties of 9 are predicted by the DFT calculations, while those of 10 are given by the linear model, but a quick look might lead to the belief that 10 is actually better than 9. The research is scientifically sound and the research question well stated. All the code and modelling notebooks and data are made freely available online. The technical details are described in sufficient detail in the manuscript, and further details are available by inspection of the provided code. The QM methodology is very well benchmarked in the supporting information and it is obvious that a lot of work has gone into this manuscript. It combines many different aspects such as library enumeration, machine learning and  automatic transition state searching with conformational search and the final product is very complete.\n\r\n1. Regarding the machine learning, it is not clear to me what is the result of the train, validation and test sets. I would assume that the data in Figure 5, Figure S6 and Figure S8 is for the test set, but this should be clarified in the figures or the captions. The presentation of the results and conclusions is very balanced, where the authors discuss also the limits of their methodology and the challenges associated with the synthesis of compound 9. \n\r\n1. The molecules in Table 2 (6-7) are said to have low barriers for back reaction due to the hydrogen-bonding favoring the s-cis VHF form. Compound 10 has the same substitution pattern with an amine at position 2 and an aldehyde at position 1. Is compound 10 expected to have a similarly inflated reaction barrier as 6-7? In this case it should be highlighted as a limitation of the approach. This especially in light of the suggestion to replace the high-throughput virtual screening approach by the GA, which could get stuck in a false minimum.\n\r\n2. The conclusion that \u201cThe overall methodological approach outlined in this paper is generally applicable to lead optimisation of properties involving chemical reactivity.\u201d is too strong and should be qualified. Not all reactivity problems will be amenable to semi-empirical methods, particularly if challenging quantum-mechanically or if there are strong solvent effects. Also, it\u2019s not certain that similar machine learning models employed will be equally successful to other reactivity problems.\n\r\n4. The GA model finds compound 10 74% of the times, but it would be interesting to know the difference in predicted performance between 10 and the best molecule in the  rest of the runs. If something nearly as good is found, that would increase the perceived usefulness of the GA even more. I have read the report by Koerstz et al. with significant interest. They describe a computational high-throughput study for finding better molecular solar heat batteries of the photo-switch dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene. The goal is to find molecules with both a higher energy storage density and a higher energy for the back reaction (longer thermal half-life) than the parent compound. They first identify the most promising molecules with 1-2 substituents, for which it is possible to test all different combinations with quantum chemistry, using a combination of semi-empirical methods and DFT. They then go on to investigate molecules with 3-7 substituents, which is a too large set for QM calculations (ca. 230 billion molecules). Instead, they train machine learning models (linear regression and LightGBM) based on the semi-empirical results of a smaller set and use the predictions of the machine learning models to single out ca 30 000 candidates for SQM calculations. Of these, the ca 1000 most promising are subjected to more accurate but time-consuming DFT calculations. The DFT calculations identify a particular candidate, molecule 9, which has promising properties in terms of a higher barrier for back reaction and a greater energy storage density than the parent compound. However, it also has lower absorption in the visible region and is challenging to obtain synthetically. Finally, the authors demonstrate that a genetic algorithm can be used together with a linear regression model to assess both the energy storage and energy of back reaction. The GA is able to quite consistently recover (72% of the runs) the best molecule in the set predicted by the linear regression model and could therefore potentially serve as a more economical alternative to the high-throughput screening that led to the discovery of molecule 9.\n\r\nAs a suggestion for future work (does not need to be added to this paper!): For the NBD-QC photo switch, the energy barrier of the back reaction and the absorption spectrum are closely related in that an increased energy storage density leads to a lower barrier for back reaction (10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00235). It would be interesting to see if this trend broadly holds true also for the DHA/VHFs studied in this set and if so, if there are ways to break the relationship. Already the fact that 9 is predicted to absorb at a similar wavelength as the parent compound is an indication that the connection might be less strong. Potentially it could also be investigated with semi-empirical methods such as sTDA or INDO/S. ", "The authors performed a high-throughput virtual screening from a combinatorial library they generated from DHA to find a suitable thermocouple pair. This methodology used semiempirical methods, DFT calculations, and machine learning methods. They found the best candidate has an energy density of 0.38 kJ/g and a half-life of 10 days 4 hours.\n\r\nThe English through the text is clear and unambiguous. I consider that it has a well-provided context and pertinent references. The Figures are overall clear and well described in the text; with the exception of figure 3, the graph labels slightly differ from what is defined in the text. I consider that the manuscript is written in a professional way, its structure is clear, and has a concise methodology. \n\r\nI consider that this manuscript meets the standard of the journal, its pertinence is well documented and the methodology is clear and unambiguous. The authors defined the research question in a clear way; they establish the methodology to find the best possible candidate using a scaffold analysis, they first consider single and double substitutions on the DHA core to calculate energy barriers and storage energies using PM3 Hamiltonian and screening the 10 best molecules from there to be calculated using DFT M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory. From these results, the authors trained a linear regression model to screen the energy barriers and storage densities of the 42^7 compounds; then focusing on storage density values greater than 0.3 kJ/g, they reduced this library to 421 M molecules.  \n\r\nFollowing the results in this reduced library, the authors trained a gradient boosted model with new PM3 calculations and performed a binned sampling to get 957k molecules which energy barrier and storage density are above 165 kJ/mol and 0.4 kJ/g, respectively. They further performed a refinement to get 34241 unique molecules to be calculated using PM3 and found around 22 k molecules with storage density above 0.4 kJ/g and perform on these a PM3 adiabatic scan, giving 1177 suitable candidates that went under DFT refinement to find the best candidate having a storage density of 0.38 kJ/g and a barrier height of 130 kJ/mol. \n\r\nThis methodology design heavily relies on PM3 calculations, which are suitable for the organic molecules considered in this library. I consider that the ML methods used (linear regression and gradient boosting decision tree) are well implemented. The authors bound the capabilities of their approach and give the community a deep insight into the energetics and storage density of these parent couples. Furthermore, they applied a genetic algorithm and get comparable results to the screening process. I consider that the findings of this work are well supported by the computational evidence the authors provided.\n\r\nThe methodology is clearly discussed. I consider that the conclusions are insightful and well supported by the evidence provided.\n\r\nThe authors perform a well-organized methodology to answer their research question.\n\r\nThey shared their datasets and code as public repo (github). I would suggest that the authors please be more explicit in how is the process of vectorizing the molecules to be feed to the ML methods are. Or if they are using a standard algorithm such as Morgan fingerprints. \n\r\nOn synthetic accessibility, I\u2019m aware that a quite small number of the possible combinatorial functionalizations could lead to synthetic viable molecules. I may suggest that, at least for the small screening library (the one tested using PM3 and TB methods), the authors could evaluate the synthetic complexity score (https://github.com/connorcoley/scscore) to have a complexity metric that can enrich the discussion of their results.  \n\r\nIn Figure 3, the labels of electronic barriers and storage energies do not coincide as the same variables in the first paragraph of the Computational Methodology, please uniform the notation. ", "- The computational pipeline introduced in this paper is very impressive and clearly well thought out and implemented. However, it is complex, with several steps involved, each using different subsets of data with different methods and models. Therefore perhaps a schematic diagram of the entire pipeline, either as a main or SI figure, would help guide the reader.\r\n- In the manuscript, when the authors mention the number of substituents considered, they sometimes write \u201c42\u201d and other times \u201c41\u201d Please make this consistent. - Can the authors add a comment somewhere in the main text on the possibilities or outlooks for comparing the predictions to experimental data? The project hinges on the assumption that the quantum chemistry calculations are an accurate representation of the ground truth values for storage energies and reaction barriers. So additional comments on how those DFT calculations are expected to correlate with experimental data would be valuable. (More specifically: I have read the section \u201cSynthetic considerations\u201d. However, what I\u2019m referring to is the possibility of connecting the predicted thermodynamic/kinetic parameters to a database of experimental data.)\r\n- In the summary and outlook, pg. 15, the authors mention \u201cFor example, their absorption profiles are not optimum.\u201d Can they add an extra sentence/phrase to explain why? - [OPTIONAL] One really nice part of the paper is when they select 109 molecules for further study with DFT. They demonstrate that the majority of the selected molecules have higher energy storage densities than the parent compound. While this is a very promising result, their argument/evidence would be strengthened even more if a statistical measure was attached to this finding. More specifically, what is the probability of finding a similar fraction of compounds with higher energy storage (than the parent compound) for random sets of 109 molecules (sampled several times). In other words, a p-value for the observed enrichment of high energy storage compounds. I\u2019m not sure if this is computationally prohibitive, so that is why I\u2019m tagging this as \u201coptional\u201d. \r\n- In summary and outlook, pg. 14, third paragraph, there is a typo: \u201c421 molecules\u201d should be \u201c421 million molecules\u201d.  \r\n- Figure S6: The acronym \u201cML\u201d appears in the figure legend, but the exact meaning of ML is not specified in the caption. Please fix this. \r\n- Figure S2: Fig. S2 (A) has green data points that are circled in black. However, no mention of what this means appears in the figure legend. I know this is mentioned in the SI text, but adding this to the figure legend might help with clarity. \r\n- I think it\u2019s great that the authors provide access to the code through a repository.

The results showed that aggregation happened in kaolinite colloidal particles, and between kaolinite and bacterial cells, but not happened in bacterial cells. This study provides interesting data for understanding the aggregation phenomena in soil and sediment. However, several aspects should be improved before publication. This paper is original research within the Aims and Scope of the journal. Speculation is welcome, but should be identified as such. Firstly, all the aggregation data were obtained by dynamic light scattering in 30 min. The authors don't tell us why 30 min, and is it enough for aggregation experiment? And what would happen if conducted a more prolonged test, for example, 60 min or 120 min?  \r\nSecondly,  P. putida is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria, and with the polar flagellum.  Generally, bacteria prefer to survive in cell groups but not a single cell. Furthermore, plenty of positively and negatively charged surface sites existed on the cell surfaces. Therefore, it is hard to understand why the bacteria could not aggregate in the present study. The authors need to provide more explanation on this point.\r\nThirdly, the aggregation between mineral colloid and bacteria could be the first step in forming soil aggregates. It is essential but not enough to explain the total aggregation phenomena in soil. More aggregation work is needed to conduct, e.g. at different pHs, to explain the aggregation better.

While this is overall comprehensible in all its parts, I must recommend English language editing to improve the clarify of certain sections, particularly the abstract, introduction, and conclusions, which can be hard to parse. There are also several typos (i.e.  Line 91: two extra characters at the start; Line 99: missing space after H3K4). Of note, I encourage the authors to be more specific when describing earlier findings (i.e. Lines 94 and 96: clarify what \"implicate\" and \"is necessary' mean in this context by indicating the specific findings of the references cited therein; Line 110: what does \"regulate\" mean here? Promote/inhibit?)\n\r\nThe literature cited is sufficient yet I notice a bias towards very recent reports. I recommend that more attention is based to the seminal findings in the field: for instance, I/R injury was first described in the 80's (PMID: 3769170).\n\r\nThe figures are well structured, but the authors should modify all bar graphs to show overlayed individual data points as per the policy of PeerJ.

Furthermore, WB raw data are provided only for the representative WB experiment; please supply the images also for the other replicates used for quantifications. The question being studied is clearly stated and of interest, though the ambition of the study is very limited in looking at the regulation of a specific gene rather than the global changes that are induced following KDM5A down regulation in H/R. The authors do admit this in the conclusions, though.\n\r\nFrom an experimental perspective my main concern is that atrial-like HL-1 cells are not a great model for H/R: not only they are hardly comparable to normal cardiomyocytes, but they are less sensitive to H/R than other more physiologically-relevant cardiac cell lines such as ventricular-like H9C2, see for reference PMID: 25450968. Authors are encouraged to validate key findings in this second cell line or, even better, in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and/or primary cardiomyocytes\n\r\nOther important remarks:\n\r\nH3K4me3 levels by WB should be presented alongside total H3, which is a better loading control than GAPDH. Indeed, consistent extraction of histones is challenging using conventional buffers such as RIPA that have physiologic pH: acid extraction is the preferred method for accurate histone WB, see PMIDs: 17545981 and this protocol from Abcam, the supplier the authors use for their histone antibodies: https://www.abcam.com/protocols/histone-extraction-protocol-for-western-blot \n\r\nI am confused as to why in Fig 2E the gating thresholds for the oe-KDM1A condition are very different from the control and NC conditions: were these experiments run on separate days? If not what else explains the overall increased Annexin V and PI signals in the KDM1A conditions? A similar inconsistency is noted in Fig 4E.\n\r\nI noticed Figs 1 and 2 use the vewry same raw data for the Blank and H/R conditions: were the experiments run at the same time?\n\r\nThe raw data for what the authors define as biological replicates are exceedingly close to one another, much more than it can be possible in my experience. This is particularly true for RT-qPCR Ct values, which are all within 0,5-1 of one another for both the housekeeping and genes of interest. Perhaps the authors consider biological replicates as multiple wells from the same culture? If so I recommend that key experiments are repeated at least twice in separate cultures (i.e. different passages of HL1 cells), so as to account for inter-experimental variability rather than intra-experimental one, which is much less meaningful.\n\r\nIn Fig. 3B findings would be strengthened by also reporting results for an unrelated genomic region (i.e. a non H3K4me3-marked domain on or around SOX9).\n\r\nFinally, I have several requests for clarifications regarding the methods:\r\n- Line 128: please provide the RefSeq ID for the specific cDNAs (and if possible deposit the plasmids to Addgene as per PeerJ policies).\r\n-  Line 128: I assume that pcDNA3.1-NC is for negative control - was this an empty plasmid? If so using an unrelated protein would have been preferable as control and could be added for at least key experiments\r\n- Line 163: please provide further details about the cytometer used, for instance the lasers and optical filter configurations\r\n- Line 182: for the loading control did the author strip and reprobe the same membrane used the protein of interest? Or were membranes cut in pieces based on the anticipated MW?\r\n- Line 187: clarify sonicator model and conditions used\r\n- Table 1: the size of some RT-qPCR amplicons seems way too big (i.e. 2.6 kb for KDM1A). Please check the sequences or clarify As mentioned above I could not examine the raw data for Figs 4-5 as well as raw data for all WB. I also await for clarification on experimental and analytical designs that are key to make a complete assessment of the robustness of the study.\n\r\nFrom the figures presented the main conclusion of the study appears to be generally supported, and there is no ove-rinterpetation of the data.

Only the Raw data for mRNA expression of CHD2 in BSA and FFA treated HepG2 cells is missing and should be added. The experimental design of the study is scientifically sound and commendable and is based on extensive analysis of the public databases. The authors have also validated the bioinformatic finding nicely with in-vitro experiments. However, the manuscript would highly benefit from elaborate explanation of the figures in the results section and in the legends. The methods have been mostly well explained in detail.

The authors can consider breaking up the figure into 2 parts so that the figure is clear. A key observation is that memory T cells also shows high expression of GTF2I in NAFLD group, and maybe expressed more than NK cells. The authors should explain in the results and the discussion, why the role of T cells was not explored further. \r\n\u2022\tThe probable GTF2I involvement in ER stress is an interesting proposition and can be followed-up in future studies by the group. However, I do feel that the ER stress biology has been unnecessarily elaborated in the discussion and can be reduced. The possibility of T cells and macrophages association with NAFLD could be discussed based on the high expression of GTF2I in these cells, and also based on knowledge in current literatures.  \r\n\u2022\tAn interesting observation is that free-fatty acids induces expression of GTF2I in HepG2 cells.

Shengjia Sun and colleagues are trying to identify the reason behind M1 macrophage polarization in myocardial infarction and trying to establish if this is exerted by exosomes derived from ferroptotic cardiomyocytes (MI-Exo). The authors have succeeded in providing compelling evidence for the involvement of exosomes derived from ferroptotic cardiomyocytes in M1 macrophage polarization. The underlying mechanism was also identified as Wnt/ \u00df-catenin pathway activation.

Also , the full \"name\" of NEDD4L (= NEDD4 Like E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase) is never explained. In addition, I miss some background related to the biochemical functions of NEDD4L, and its close relative, NEDD4, in particular their role in ubiquitination of proteins and degradation of target proteins by the proteasome. That should be the 1st paragraph of the introduction, and clearly relates to the findings related to NOTCH2 functions, explained later. \n\r\nThen, one may also wonder about the relevance of NEDD4, in a study about NEDD4L: how closely related are these 2 family members? Do they partially overlap or complement each others functions; can one replace the others, etc. This would be relevant for understanding the effects of only knocking down one of these 2 related genes. \n\r\nSmaller issues: \n\r\nEnglish language use is mostly okay, but there are a number of typos and glitches, even in the abstract, that need to be fixed. For example (from abstract, line 36): \"NEDD4L facilitates LUAD progression by activating Notch signaling, and may be a promising target for treat LUAD.\"  Should either mean \"to treat\" or \"for treatment of\"....\n\r\nLine 89: \"Total RNAs were isolated from LUAD cells\"....should mean:  total RNA was isolated \n\r\nLine 117: \"A549 cells were overexpressed with NEDD4L and were then treated with Chx\". Thats just not a good sentence... There are no major flaws with the description of the research methods. The authors have used a good spectrum of different methods that partly supplement each other, and covered mRNA and protein gene expression equally well. They have looked into effects on tumor and normal cells and even used mouse xenograft studies. In addition, when cell lines were used, typically more than just one line has been used and there should be no major discrepancies that arent covered here; such as when researchers only use a single cell line for all experiments. \n\r\nIt is also to mention that the authors did not only generate gene knock-down studies (by siRNA or shRNA vectors), but also tested the opposing concept: overexpression of the target gene, in comparison to down-regulation. Also here, different cell lines were used which complement each other. These data are rather trustworthy and the experimental design provides no points for major criticism. \n\r\nOne could question if the use of 10 nude mice for the xenograft studies provides sufficient statistical power, especially if there were minor phenotypic effects of NEDD4L-knockdown.\n\r\nOtherwise, the statistical evaluation of results appears appropriate and there are no conclusions anywhere from doubtful statistical procedures or misinterpretations. One may wonder why the cell lines have only partially reduced expression of NEDD4L since there appears such a positive benefit for loss of function of this target for cell proliferation and growth. Is it in fact gene dosage of NEDD4L expression and functions that are tightly regulated in these cells, while total loss of function appears to be avoided - also in tumor tissues? How do the authors explain this? \n\r\nWhat is the reason for the repression of NEDD4L expression in tumor tissues - have the authors explored the possibility of genetic alterations (deletions) in at least some of the tumors? This could be at least discussed. \n\r\nGenerally, the reduction of NOTCH2 and particular NOTCH1 levels observed are not very pronounced, especially when significant changes of NODD4L levels are introduced. This raises the question if this is functionally really that significant - and if NEDD4L may rather have many pleiotropic effects on many different genes? This would be expected, as it is involved in regulating the function of the proteasome and protein degradation efficacy inside the cell. Would knocking down NOTCH2 expression (by siRNA?) result in comparable phenotypic effects? Pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH receptors is done (Fig. 4), but this targets all NOTCH receptors and downstream activities (plus a spectrum of off-target effects). Knocking down the NOTCH receptors specifically - in particular, NOTCH1 and 2 - would have been more conclusive. \n\r\nThe non-overlapping nature of NEDD4 versus NEDD4L is discussed in the last paragraph of the manuscript, and it is critical that this is done. This part, however, could also be at least mentioned in the introduction. It leaves the reader poised for the question the entire time you read the manuscript: are these 2 genes doing the same job? \n\r\nNevertheless, the question about biological redundancy remains: NOTCH1 and 2 may be affected - but how are expression levels of these 2 relative to EACH other? In figure 3, the effects of NEDD4L knock-down or overexpression on NOTCH1-4 proteins are shown. But Western blots are not really quantitative and cannot be compared to each other if different antibodies are used. What are the relative expression levels of NOTCH1-4 compared to each other? Is NOTCH2 maybe the most abundantly expressed of the 4 receptors? This should be addressed - it may further support the main findings and their interpretation. It appears that NOTCH2 is the only NOTCH receptor that is frequently affected by genetic mutations (usually amplifications) in lung adenocarcinoma. I would therefore almost expect that NOTCH2 is functionally more important in this cancer subtype than the other 3. The main problem with this manuscript is probably related to the non-specificity of NEDD4L functions: it may target a large number of targets, of which NOTCH1 and 2 are just 2 examples. So this opens a bunch of questions that are actually less related to NEDD4L (and its relative NEDD4), but to NOTCH signaling. How do we know that an active NOTCH signaling pathway is a positive thing for the tumor cells? Only about 10% of the LUADs show overexpression of NOTCH receptors - and interestingly, this is mostly NOTCH2. IN almost all of these tumors, genetic amplification of the NOTCH2 locus can be observed. These tumors may indeed strongly benefit from increased NOTCH signaling - and reducing NOTCH levels would be expected to result in lower proliferation rates. However - what is with the rest of 80-90% of tumors that either shows no changes in NOTCH activity or expression - or even have inactivating mutations? It would be interesting to correlate expression levels and gain-of-function in NOTCH2 in the r tumor cell lines with the findings. Are these cell lines showing true activation of NOTCH2 activity, or NOTCH pathway activity; do they harbor amplification, or is NOTCH not really increased in these? That's, to me, an outstanding question. \r\nIf NOTCH activities in the 3 cell lines aren't fundamentally critical for tumor growth, and not highly activated in comparison to normal lung epithelia - then the NOTCH pathway may not be the best target for exploring NEDD4L functions. ", "The manuscript is overall well-written. However, I would recommend the authors to proofread it once more due to some minor errors spotted during my read. To exemplify, a few of the errors are listed below:\n\r\n1) Abstract: Line 2 \"ubiquitin ligase\" instead of \"ubiquitinligase.\"\r\n2) Line 120: \"interference\" in place of \"interfere.\"\r\n3) Line 136: \"Colony formation assay\" in place of \"clone formation assay.\" The experimental design has been sufficient to address the question of how NEDD4L impacts proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Within that scope, however, it does not provide evidence for decrease in the protein levels of Notch2 and/or its downstream molecules within the mouse tumors (for example: IHC of tumors with Notch2 Ab and NEDD4L). \n\r\nNow, in terms of addressing the main question of how NEDD4L downregulation results in tumor progression via Notch2, the authors miss the point that tumor proliferation is only one facet of cancer advancement. Invasiveness, metastasis, stemness, etc., are other important features that define tumor progression. \n\r\nIt is highly recommend that the authors at least show whether impact on Notch2 protein levels by modulating NEDD4L levels causes any change in migratory and/or invasive tendencies of LUAD cells. (ref: ALCAP2 inhibits lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion via the ubiquitination of \u03b2-catenin by upregulating the E3 ligase NEDD4L; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324825/).\n\r\nThe authors should also acknowledge in the 'Discussion' section the following:\n\r\n1. NEDD4L modifies the protein levels of multiple other oncogenic molecules in lung adenocarcinoma and the effect on proliferation shown in the manuscript here to be via Notch2 downregulation is not the only mechanism. For example, PI3K/Akt pathway is also activated by Notch2 to increase proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma (ref: NEDD4L-induced ubiquitination mediating UBE2T degradation inhibits progression of lung adenocarcinoma via PI3K-AKT signaling; https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-021-02341-9).\n\r\n2. Since the authors have shown that NEDD4L expression is inversely correlated with stage of tumor, it is advisable to discuss the relevance of conducting future studies with different forms of mutated EGFR (commonly found in advanced LUAD patients) and checking whether upregulation of NEDD4L will be helpful in a certain subset of such patients (ref: Downregulation of NEDD4L by EGFR signaling promotes the development of lung adenocarcinoma; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12967-022-03247-4). ", "In this manuscript the authors compare the expression of NEDD4L between normal and tumor tissues and find that the protein is downregulated in tumor samples. Using various in vitro and in vivo assays they demonstrate that NEDD4L regulates proliferation and tumor progression via notch pathway.\r\nI have several major and minor concerns that need to be addressed.\r\n1. I would strongly recommend a immunohistochemical or immunocytochemical analysis of the involved proteins in cell lines or the primary tissues. As localization of proteins involved in notch pathway is critical for its location, the information is highly desirable. \r\n2. Mention how far the normal tissue was from the tumor part.\r\n3. What does 5/28 in line 169 signify?\r\n4. Did the authors observe any correlation between levels of NEDD4l and morphology or proliferation rates in the cell lines?\r\n5. The figures 3B and 2D need to be quantified.\r\n6. In the results, briefly explain how to interpret the assay and results in Figure 3D.\r\n7. In Figure 4, did they wrongly write NICD as NICH?\r\n8. As PEERJ is an online journal, would it make sense to have color graphs which make it easier for the reader to distinguish between lines?\r\n9. English language and grammar needs to be revised throughout the manuscript. "], "13385": ["Thank you for providing the Table 1 Label free quantification analysis.

The introduction has been written in a vague manner. Instead of elaborating on the disease activity parameters and symptom flare, the authors should describe the limitations of hitherto known urinary biomarkers. The part: 'To protect important organs and ........... accompanied by irreversible organ damage' is redundant and irrelevant. A concise note on the urinary biomarkers would help readers understand the current scenario about them in SLE. The experimental design can not be commented upon unless the below-mentioned 3 parameters are addressed adequately.\n\r\n1. Why have the authors chosen to use the 1997 Lupus classification criteria which have now been replaced by the 2012 SLICC and 2019 ACR/EULAR criteria?\n\r\n2. Dividing patients' severity status just based on SLEDAI is incorrect. They also need to see that renal SLEDAI (rSLEDAI) which is a sum of all the 4 renal parameters of SLEDAI is also taken into account. For example, a patient with arthritis, skin rash, and raised anti-ds DNA/low complements would score >5 on SLEDAI but can not be called a severe disease whereas a patient with nephrotic range proteinuria with raised anti-ds DNA/low complements would also fall into the same group but would be classified as severe disease as he/she would need more intense immunosuppression as compared to the previous one. This is a major drawback of the study where patients with and without renal involvement have been grouped together on the basis of the same SLEDAI value which is likely to give incorrect results. For this kind of study, it is imperative that patients of the same kind i.e. renal active OR non-renal active be classified separately into mild, moderate, and high disease activity.\n\r\n3. How have the authors defined active and stable disease? If they have used SLEDAI, what's the definition of active disease as per the SLEDAI value? The validity of the findings would further depend upon the case definition which needs to be elaborated as per my comments in the above section. ", "In the article \"Different roles of urinary light chains and serum light chains as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus\", the authors investigated the changes of antibody light chain components in serum and urine in order to develop a more precise and diagnostic biomarker for systemic lupus erythematosus. Since SLE is known to be an auto-immune disease, the carried out study compared and contrast the antibody light chain components between active and stable SLE patients, and established a diagnosis guideline using these information at the end.

For the ten samples used for screening and identification of the urine proteins, the authors need to clarify whether/how N=5 was picked for each group and was representative for the group. Especially, which one category, mild, moderate or severe, was chosen for the active group? The presented data from serum protein comparisons, although in some cases statistically significant, do not show distinguishable changes to be a reliable bio-marker among patients with different disease severity. Would \u201cexpanding the sample size\u201d really make the changes more significant as the authors proposed? Or, it might just be a worse indicator compared to urine samples.

Experimental design is well done General Comments\n\r\n    This is an interesting study, assessing the changes in blood biochemical markers and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) in young male soccer players (n=18, mean age 18 years) following 6-month training period (January-June). Blood biochemical markers (cortisol, creatine kinase, serotonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor \u2013 BDNF) were measured four times: at the beginning of the preparation period, immediately after the preparation period, in the middle of the competitive period, and at the end of the competitive period. Blood samples were taken from players who had been out of training for about 36 hours (or 36 hours after training). The training loads were assessed using a session RPE, and the assessment time points were chosen so that fatigue after a soccer match would not be assessed. \n\r\nThe main findings of this study were that: (1) after the pre-season (most demanding training) period the values of all measured blood biochemical markers increased significantly; (2) the reduction of training loads in the competitive period resulted in a systematic decrease in the values of the measured blood biochemical markers; (3) the one exception was the BDNF concentration, which increased significantly. The latter could be related to mental and physical stress accrued over the course of the training time.\r\nThis text is well-written in general. However, before it is published, the design of this work should be improved. \n\r\n1. I suggest not to use the term \"indicators central fatigue (assessed by serotonin and BDNF) and peripheral fatigue (assessed by cortisol and creatine kinase)\" in context of this study in Title and for explanation of the results of this study in Discussion and Conclusion. Fatigue during prolonged exercise has been defined as the inability to maintain the required or expected muscle force/power output that leads to a loss of performance in a given task (Edwards RH. 1981). This definition is generally accepted by exercise physiologist. In this study, the changes in force-generation capacity of skeletal muscles or in physical of performance (fatigue and recovery) were not studied. Neuromuscular (physical) fatigue is indicator of acute (short-time) adaptation to exercise. In this study, the long-term (chronic) adaptation to soccer training loads during 6-months period was assessed by 4 blood biochemical markers: cortisol \u2013 typical marker of chronic stress, creatine kinase \u2013 typical marker of muscle damage, serotonin \u2013 which is also marker of central fatigue, but only in complex with other central factors that might limit exercise performance (Meeusen R et al., Sports Med, 2006), and BDNF \u2013 participates in physiological processes such as glycogen homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Jimenez-Maldonado A et al. Front Neurosci, 2018). I suggest to use for explanation of the changes in blood biochemical markers in context of this study using terms \"exercise-related stress\", or \"training stress\". These terms more undestandable in context of long-term adaptation to training loads in young soccer playes. \n\r\n2.

The study is of clinical significance and provides potential therapeutic targets. 1.\tAuthors well studied the miR-9-5p/DLX3/Myf5 axis in mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cell line. Major experiments should be reproduced in a second cell line. \r\n2.\tIn Figure 2C, miR-9-5p mimics increased myotube numbers compared to NC mimics while miR-9-5p inhibitor decreased myotube numbers compared to NC inhibitor.

The data does not support the conclusion that the increased miR-9-5p expression participates the myogenic differentiation. ", "In this study, Dong et al proposed that the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells was regulated by miR-9-5p/Dlx3/Myf5 axis. They found Dlx3 was decreased, whereas miR-905p was increased, during myogenic differentiation. And miR-9-5p promoted myotube formation via decreasing Dlx3. In addition, the suppression of the myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells were mediated by Dlx3, and that was associated with its capacity in reducing Myf5. This is a straightforward study. It is easy to follow. Following are the comments:\r\n1. Language editing is needed. I would suggest the authors to seek help from a native English speaker.\r\n2.

For example, the change of Myod1 was barely visible after miR-9-5p inhibitor treatment in Figure 2B. However, the authors indicated there was significant decrease in their quantification plot. I would strongly suggest the authors to reverify there western blot results. Almost every WB data has this issue. In addition, the Myf5 bands in Figure 2B are hazy.\r\n5. According to the data, Myod1 was also changed after miR-9-5p mimic and inhibitor treatment, and after knockdown or overexpressing Dlx3.  Why did the authors were more interested in Myf5?\r\n6.

Inexperienced readers may misunderstand this image therefore, putting pointing marks could be beneficial. 1- Although some additional techniques might be used in the study, the used methodology is acceptable for answering the research question.\n\r\n2- Is it possible for authors to use more appropriate staining technics for paraffin sections if you still have unstained sections or blocks available? Staining techniques such as Masson Goldner trichrome staining, Movat\u2019s pentachrome staining, etc. are commonly used staining technics to see tissue transitions and identify all tissue types relevant with the osteogenesis which would allow you to address different tissue types much better. For example, in the last image (high magnification MC3T3-PCL) of figure 7, some of the NB areas are probably consist of cartilage and there\u2019s a fibro-cartilage transition area as well but H&E staining is not providing enough details to fully identify these structures.  \n\r\n3- For my detailed comments and further questions, please see the last page of the annotated manuscript (After line 664). 1- The title of the manuscript is indicating the effect of \u201cscaffold geometry\u201d, but I believe the used methodology and obtained results are not sufficient to say anything about the effect of geometry. HA and PCL are entirely different materials and as it is mentioned in the manuscript, they have some different qualities effecting the osteogenesis. If the HA and PCL had the same geometry, could we expect to get similar results between the experimental groups? The geometry of scaffolds indeed proved to have good amount of influence but scientists usually use different geometrical patterns with same type of material like using HA scaffolds in hexagonal geometry vs HA scaffolds in square geometry. Therefore, the title must be changed and all the statements related with scaffold geometry should be discarded.\n\r\n2- Line 420: Line 420: To evaluate cellular adhesion, other technics should be taken into consideration. If you\u2019re making this statement depending upon your electron microscopy imaging results, please refer this analysis in the sentence. Otherwise, it feels like your MTT results provided this knowledge of enhanced adhesion.\n\r\n3- Line 444: \"and once they form multilayers they start mineralization (Yu et al., 2017).\"\r\nIn this article Yu et al. mentions double-layered cell transfer method (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33286 ). There\u2019s no mentioning of that the cells start mineralization when they become multilayered. Please revise this statement.\n\r\n4- Line 466: Changing \u201csuccessful osteoblast formation\u201d to \u201csuccessful induction of osteogenic differentiation.\u201d could be a better choice. There are several cellular steps throughout the osteogenic differentiation starting with mesenchymal stem cells to osteocytes and beginning from the early osteoprogenitors, those cells express ALP gene and produce ALP enzyme. Therefore, saying successful osteoblast formation is a bit assertive as these cells could be of any cell type from an early progenitor to a mature osteoblast.\n\r\n5-Line 522-523:\u201dThe infiltration of connective tissue resulted from the interaction between MC3T3-E1 cells and the osteoconductive property of HA scaffold\u201d\r\nWhich results are refering to this statement? Connective tissue normally does not infiltrate into an area. In normal physiological healing, cells do migrate to defect area and they differentiate form a fibrous tissue. Afterwards cells do condensate and form fibro-cartilage tissue parts which would enlarge and form a cartilage later on. Cells keep on differentiating and due to vascularization and ALP activity, osteoid structures occur in the defect site. Please change the statement for this part.\n\r\n6- For my other comments please see the annotated manuscript that I upload (After line 664). Auth\u0131ors had investigated the qualities of HA and PCL scaffolds seeded with MC3T3 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Although the study is well planned, I believe the manuscript could use some improvements and some changes also had to be made starting with the title of the study.

The article has included an introduction from a wide perspective to explain the background of the work and demonstrate how this work contributed to the field.

In my opinion, the order by which Figures 2 and 3 are presented should be reversed for a better flow, i.e. the current Figure 3 (exosome characterization) should be Figure 2 and the current Figure 2 (histological examination of the lung tissue upon exosome injection) should be Figure 3. \n\r\nFor Figure 6, what does the panel legend (N and S) represent?

The authors should provide clear elaborations for any acronyms used in the manuscript. The authors mentioned in line 117 that nothing was given to the rats in the control group. In my opinion, the authors should repeat the experiment with PBS solution for the airway injection for the control groups so as to eliminate any possibility that the lung injury could be induced during the injection process, rather than the LPS.\n\r\nThe authors \"randomly\" selected 5 of the top 30 differentially expressed lncRNAs for qRT_PCR validation. In my opinion, it is more biologically meaningful if the authors could provide a rationale for the selection process, or select the top 5 most dysregulated lncRNAs of a particular important KEGG or GO pathway for qPCR validation, or simply the top 5 most differentially expressed lncRNAs for qPCR validation so as to provide the basis for future studies. The authors concluded that there was an increased neutrophil infiltration (line 230-231) in the lung tissues of the ALI group compared to control, but there is no quantitative measurement to convincingly demonstrate that. The authors should perform via for example, flow cytometry, to quantitatively demonstrate the % neutrophil infiltration and examine any differences between the two groups. Major comments\n\r\n1) For the current Figure 2 whereby the authors demonstrated the histological differences between rats injected with PBS or ALI-derived exosomes, more quantitative assays should be performed just as in Figure 1, i.e. Wet-dry ratio, neutrophil infiltration, cytokine secretion.\n\r\n2) While characterizing the exosomes isolated from the BALF of the rats (Figure 3), the authors should also checked for any differences in the abundance/quantity of exosomes between the ALI and control groups since it has been reported that LPS (infectious stimuli) can lead to an increase in EV secretion.\n\r\n3) While the authors provided the lncRNA-miRNA regulatory network predictions for the 5 validated lncRNAs, it may be more biologically meaningful to compare any overlaps of the network between the 5 lncRNAs or provide a merged network for some of the differentially expressed lncRNAs of the same GO or KEGG pathway. This would provide a stronger basis for future experimental studies to characterize these lncRNAs and their potential diagnostic and therapeutic roles in ALI.

On the other hand, the subsequent analyses were performed with databases from HCCs and normal livers. As S100B appears to be mainly expressed in immune cells in normal liver (leaving cellular distribution in HCC unclear). It is unclear if hypoxia also up-regulates S100B expression in immune cells, how hypoxia is related to tumor hypoxia.

They also discovered that HIF-1 binds to HREs in the S100B promoter region and increases its expression. They also discovered a direct association between S100B and HIF-1. In the HepG2 cell line, S100B is also involved in hypoxia-induced cell migration and invasion. The authors discovered that S100B was primarily found in T cells and Kupffer cells in normal liver, indicating a significant correlation with immune response in the liver. They discovered a positive relationship between S100B expression and infiltration levels of immune cells using TIMER analysis. They also reported a positive relationship with immunomodulators. Based on these findings, the authors claim that S100B expression aids in the recruitment and migration of immune cells in the HCC tumor microenvironment. Overall, this is a nice paper with carefully gathered data. It is well written and provides interesting mechanistic insights into how S100B regulates the HCC tumor environment under hypoxic conditions.

Please explain why you used this dataset despite the accessibility of many more RNAseq and microarray data from other public databases.\r\n- To confirm the reliability of the analyzed results, the expression levels of all candidate genes in VC using different datasets and different databases have to be further examined.\r\n- The immunohistochemistry or ELISA in human samples must be used to confirm the bioinformatics finding.

To serve as therapy for VC, the regimen must function, to the minumum, in the opposite direction from the change in expression between VC model and the control group.

In addition to the discovery of the 5  hub genes, the authors are advised to discuss how the identified GO terms from GSEA and KEGG are relevant to the VC progression.  Currently, some of the GO terms were not easily relatable to the VC progression.

Add an approval of bioethics statement to conduct the experiment by using live virus. ", "The presented work seeks to discover antiviral compounds which may be candidates for treating COVID-19. The question of which drug treatments might improve patient outcomes in COVID-19 is the subject of ongoing research in the field. The presented work follows a valid investigation and contributes a result towards that research effort.\n\r\nThe article is written with clear English. There are some minor mistakes with spelling and grammar which do not substantially affect the article's content. There is an issue with the capitalisation of some proper nouns in the article, such as \"glide\" (referring to the docking software \"Glide\"), \"protein data bank\" (\"Protein Data Bank\"), and so on. On lines 102-103, the sentence \"production stages were done over simulation times of 20 and 100 ns with NPT ensemble was adopted\" is confusing, and on line 104 \"algorithmfor\" is missing a space. There should be a space between numbers and their units, such as in \"50ps\" (\"50 ps\") or \"300K\" (\"300 K\"). Although these are minor issues, the authors should consider double-checking the prose in order to improve the readability of the article. \n\r\nThe introduction adequately describes the motivation for the research. However, the section does not support or contextualise the in vitro screening part of the study, despite this being crucial to its core output, which is the 37% reduction of replication after 48 hours demonstrated for Birinapant. The authors should expand the introduction to the article to make clear the importance of the in vitro assay to produce evidence for establishing a candidate treatment. The Introduction section also lacks a sufficient review of similar in silico / in vitro screening studies aimed at drug / antiviral repurposing, so such a review should be undertaken and added. The authors have chosen to undertake in silico screening first, followed by an in vitro screen for the best-scoring compounds, and this is a standard approach for drug repurposing. The two stages of docking and the stage of molecular dynamics have been described well.\n\r\nNeither the section \"Construction of drugs and compounds dataset\" beginning line 71, nor the referenced Table 1, describes the fingerprint or structure similarity methods used to create the compound library. This section must be made more detailed. There are three questions which should be answered: what were the seed compounds of the search (known antivirals), how were compounds generated to be tested against those seeds, and which methods were used to assess compound similarity? \n\r\nOn line 72 and in Table 1, it is written that a set of 37,060 compounds were tested, but in Supplementary File 1 (\"SP docking results\") 47,068 results are listed. No subsequent references to Supplementary File 1 explain the discrepancy. The authors should describe more clearly the dataset that is being presented in Supplementary File 1. Which 47,068 compounds were used?\n\r\nVero E6 is an appropriate cell line for this kind of SARS-CoV-2 infection study. The provenance is described as the Korean Cell Line Bank in the subsection \"Cell line and virus\" beginning on line 116. The authors' description is missing an account of how the cell line has been authenticated and checked by the authors for possible contamination, which should be part of the quality control process for this experiment [DOI:10.1023/A:1022949730029, DOI:10.1038/bjc.2014.166]. The same subsection outlines that the SARS-CoV-2 sample used by the authors was NCCP No. 43326. The authors may wish to insert a sentence to clarify that viral samples based on NCCP No. 43326 are the wildtype virus, i.e. GISAID clade S, PANGOLIN lineage A. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 are of pressing importance, and the wildtype is no longer the most relevant strain to the COVID-19 pandemic, so explicitly mentioning the lineage used in the experiment will help clarify the applicability of the research. The in silico portion supports prior in silico investigations regarding the antiviral drug Birinapant, which conclude it has the potential to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting Mpro [DOI:10.1080/07391102.2020.1805019]. The in silico work also highlights Atazanavir, for which there are also ongoing investigations [DOI:10.1101/2020.04.04.020925, DOI:10.1186/s13063-020-04987-8]. The in vitro validation focuses on these two drugs and presents a positive result for Birinapant inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vero E6 cell line at 10 \u03bcM after 48 hours. \n\r\nIn lines 19-20 of the abstract, a claim is made that \"no new drug or vaccine has been approved for treating SARS CoV-2 infections\". The antiviral drug Remdesivir has already been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g. by the MHRA in the UK), which followed the results of the ACTT-1 trial last year [DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2007764]. Monoclonal antibodies have also recently been approved (e.g. by the MHRA) as a treatment for COVID-19 [DOI:10.1136/bmj.n2083]. There are also now clearly many approved vaccines which are efficacious at preventing COVID-19. The statement appears to be severely outdated and must be updated to reflect the current state of research into treatments for COVID-19.\n\r\nIn line 36 of the abstract, it is claimed that \"Birinapant can be used to treat COVID-19.\" This is a strong claim which is not adequately supported by the experimental result presented, which is a 37% reduction of replication in an in vitro assay based on the Vero E6 cell line. Claims that something is a treatment should be supported by clinical evidence. In the case of this research, it would be more accurate to conclude that Birinapant is a candidate for further investigation in order to establish whether it is an effective treatment. A similar point is made in the Discussion section on lines 270-271, saying \"Birinapant's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity supports its usage as an anti-COVID-19 medication\", and this should also be updated to say e.g. \"...supports further investigation into its usage...\".\n\r\nThe results of the docking and molecular dynamics stages of the study are well-presented and sufficient raw datasets for those stages have been provided in the supplementary information.\n\r\nThe caption for Figure 7 lists the concentration tested as 10 mM, which is also present in lines 128-129 of the Methods section. However, a value of 10 \u03bcM is written in the abstract as well as in the \"SARS-CoV-2 Plaque inhibition assay\" subsection of the Results section. The value tested was presumably 10 \u03bcM, as per similar studies, so the authors should clarify or correct the \"10 mM\" values. This subsection refers to \"Fig. 6\", but it seems the matching figure would be \"Fig. 7\". Furthermore, it would be helpful for the authors to supply a table of raw data for Figure 7 in the supplementary information. \n\r\nOn line 230, it is stated that \"the estimated IC 50 values for birinapant was 18\u00b13.6 \u00b5M.\" It must be stated, possibly in the Methods section, how this value is estimated, and any further raw data that is relevant should be provided in a figure in the main text and in a table in the supplementary information. Can the authors produce a dose-response curve to support the asserted value? The value should then be related to comparable values in other in vitro COVID-19 replication inhibition studies, such as to Remdesivir in Vero E6 cells [DOI:10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786]. \n\r\nThe Discussion section does not mention important context from the field for the two compounds that were primarily investigated, Birinapant and Atazanavir. Birinapant was highlighted last year by an in silico study following a similar method of docking then molecular dynamics [DOI:10.1080/07391102.2020.1805019]. The authors should relate their work to this earlier study - the in silico part supports its conclusions, and the in vitro work extends the evidence for the candidacy of Birinapant for further work. Atazanavir has also been the subject of a mixed in silico / in vitro investigation [DOI:10.1128/AAC.00825-20]. Like in this work, it was found by Fintelman-Rodrigues et al. that Atazanavir undergoes stable binding with a strong binding energy to Mpro. However, the Fintelman-Rodrigues study found that Atazanavir exhibits antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells in vitro, and then goes on to establish that the inhibition of replication holds in human cells. The disagreement between this work and the in vitro part of the Fintelman-Rodrigues study should be discussed, particularly in the context of upcoming clinical trials involving Atazanavir [DOI:10.1186/s13063-020-04987-8]. The core research behind this work, in which Birinapant is selected in silico from a large panel of compounds and then its activity verified in vitro, is promising. However, the article would need major revision in order to fully describe the work done and to contextualise its place within the current body of literature. Particularly, there are methods used which have not been described; the authors have not related the work to any relevant developments in COVID-19 therapeutics over the last year, including comparable in silico and in vitro studies; and some of the stated discussion and conclusions of the study are not supported by the results generated. ", "\u201cTo date, no new drug or vaccine has been approved for treating SARS CoV-2 infections\u201d \u2013 In fact there are many vaccines that have been approved and a host of new drugs are in development. This is clearly a naive statement that should be revised.\n\r\nGenerally, the authors do not acknowledge the work of other groups in this area. For example, birinapant has been identified by other studies of a similar nature to that submitted by the authors but these are not cited.\n\r\ne.g. \nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07391102.2020.1805019\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07391102.2020.1768151\n\r\nI feel that many of the compounds identified in this study have been identified by others with a similar or identical approach - the authors do little to recognise this. The experimental design appears to be sound and the plaque assays are an important addition. The paper is clearly written and the findings of the paper are generally supported by the data presented.\r\nRMSD and gyration figures are very difficult interpret and should be separated. E.g. Fig. 5. the data for birinapant is barely visible. Generally, this is a useful addition to the SARS-CoV-2 molecular docking repurposing genre, especially since the wet lab data is included. I feel that many of the compounds identified in this study have been identified by others with a similar or identical approach - the authors do little to recognise this. "], "12726": ["This paper is written in proper English, suitable for international audience. Paper background and the overall problem are described in clear and comprehensible way. Previous research referred by the authors are relevant and referenced correctly and in consistent form. Paper structure match the PeerJ standards. Figures and tables are adequate, properly described and supplement well the description of obtained results. Authors supplied raw data as well as additional figures. Nonetheless, minor drawbacks appear in several lines - detailed comments are given below.\n\r\nLines 45-49. \r\nPlease check the completeness of the first part of the sentence \u2018Currently, 19 provinces in China, including Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Shaanxi (Lu 2019), have been introduced and cultivated, but there are significant differences in the content of active ingredients in the same species of S. miltiorrhiza planted in different regions (Huang et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2011b).\u2019 - the object is probably in wrong position. \n\r\nPlease consider such solution: \u2018Currently, 19 provinces in China, including Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Shaanxi (Lu 2019), have been introduced and cultivated S. miltiorrhiza, but there are significant differences in the content of active ingredients in the same species planted in different regions (Huang et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2011b).\u2019\n\r\nLines 129-132.\r\nI suggest to revise an order of the sentence \u2018Therefore, in the BP training, select the input Xi of the input layer neuron i, the weight Wij from the input layer neuron i to the hidden layer neuron j, the threshold value \u03b8j of the hidden layer neuron j, and the output yj of the hidden layer neuron j is calculated by Equation 1:\u2019 since it\u2019s a little bit incomprehensible. The better solution would be to start the sentence with \u2018The output yj of the hidden layer neuron j is calculated by Equation 1:\u2019 or something similar, then give the formula followed by description of its all components (a description similar to given in lines 144-145 should be suitable). \n\r\nLines 135-137. \r\nThe same comment as above.\n\r\nLines 212-213. \r\nThere is probably lack of object in sentence \u2018The water-soluble components (D1-D4, D11, and D12) showed a higher degree with Mn, Cu, Zn, N, P, and K.\u2019 Degree of what? Please review this sentence. Line 140. \r\nPlease check if the formula given in line 140 is correct. Usually the error function is the sum of squares (or sum of squared error known as SSE), which is minimized during training process. The formula given by Authors is rather square of sum, which could give the same results but only if in parenthesis the minuend is higher than the subtrahend. Moreover, Wang et al. (2019) after Rumelhart et al. (1986) claims that \u2018The algorithm is a multilayer supervised learning network trained using the methods of mean square error (MSE) and gradient descent, which involves adopting a learning rule with the steepest gradient descent method to achieve the minimum sum of squared error.\u2019, which suggests that formula given by Authors may be just written incorrectly. However, if formula is correct, please include some reference to justify this way of error computing.\n\r\nPlease provide information about transfer (activation) functions between input and hidden layer as well as between hidden and output layer of ANN. What were the functions? identity, sigmoid (S-shape), hiperbolic tangent, sinusoid, negatively exponential, Gaussian? Please provide the formulas or references, if possible. Additionally, information about number of training epochs, learning rate and convergence criterion should be given.\n\r\nI suggest to explain clearly somewhere in the sub-division BP (back propagation) neural network what authors mean using term \u2018Test data\u2019 (it appears in Table 1). Generally, in ANN-related issues 3 kinds of data sets are reported: training set (other words input data or input vectors) - data presented constantly to the ANN in order to realise training process according to appropriate algorithm, validation set (the subset of input data) - data used for supervision of ANN training process, most of all to avoid network overfitting, which is very common in case of BP learning algorithm, and test set - data never used for training but necessary for final evaluation of ANN and calculation of fit-measures. I suppose that term 'Test data' concerns the latter, but very often term \u2018validation set\u2019 is used interchangeably with the term \u2018test set\u2019 and refers to assessment the performance of a fully-trained model, which might be confusing, especially for readers unfamiliar with ANN terminology. To avoid confusion please define clearly the role of test set or refer to an appropriate source (e.g. Ripley, 1996).\n\r\nRipley B.D. 1996. Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks. Cambridge University Press, UK., pp. 354. Lines 146-147 and 223-264\r\nI have a serious objection to the size of training data set, especially taking into account ANN architecture. It is not about the percentage (this is ok) but the quantity of training vectors (18 cases).  Figure 6 presents ANN structure with 8 inputs, 16 hidden nodes and 7 outputs which give 8\u00d716\u00d77 = 896 network connections (other words parameters (weights) to select in each iteration). Although selection of weights is realised on the training set, the final task of ANN is reproduction, which means that the real goal of network training is to minimize so-called generalization error, not training error. Generalization error is a function of data density and network complexity measure, called VCdim (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) measure (Vapnik, 1992). A small number of training samples (low data density), with a fixed measure of VCdim, leads to model overfitting and bad generalization, as the approximation task is reduced to interpolation and the model becomes susceptible to reproduction of disturbances as a basic features. According to Hush and Horne (1993) good generalization of ANN may be obtained if number of training vectors exceeds VCdim by at least 10 times. Since there is no simple relationship between VCdim measure and network architecture, it is only possible to estimate its lower and upper limit, which approximately correspond to number of weights connecting input with hidden layer and twice the number of all network weights, respectively. In practice, VCdim measure is assumed as the number of all network weights (number of all network connections). Having ANN architecture proposed by the Authors, minimum 8960 training vectors are required to ensure good generalization abilities of such model. Dataset contains only 26 observations, one for each specific location and plant type (cultivated or wild). Since there are no biological replications for each location, no variability of studied natural phenomenon was captured which also provides to uncertainty of other results presented in this paper. I strongly suggest to include additional training vectors (much more than 18) by making biological replications. With additional data Authors may use also some analytical methods based on known algorithms, e.g. bootstrap, to increase the size of training set \u2013 nonetheless these methods need data dispersion (variance). Then I suggest to (a) revise the ANN architecture towards reducing the number of hidden neurons or (b) try different solution, e.g. the set of networks (one for each dependent variable to reduce network connections) or (c) try different kind of network which realizes multidimensional regression and is much more resistant to a limited number of training vectors, e.g. Support Vector Machine for regression (Drucker et al., 1997). \n\r\nVapnik V.N. 1992.

In addition there is impossible to perform such comparisons using statistical approach, since there is no data replication in dataset, hence no dispersion measure may be calculated. Therefore, it may be written that Shandong and other producing areas differ in terms of analysed features, but nothing confirms that these differences are significant (this term is reserved for specific, statistical uses).

Another strength is clear, concise and generally reliable description of research tasks (with minor failings). \n\r\nNonetheless, this work has serious methodological drawback and that is why I suggest a major revision of this paper. I'm not convinced to the results obtained by the Authors. This is due to the lack of proper representation of analysed phenomenon. At the same time, I strongly emphasize that I have no objection to the method of obtaining data from the collected soil and plant samples, but to the lack of fundamental feature of experimental data - replication, which provide the knowledge about variability/diversity of natural phenomena. Consequently, the authors obtained high value of correlation coefficients which turned out to be insignificant (this is an indication that something is wrong with the data). In addition, it is not possible to check the basic properties of variables (distributions, collinearity, the influence of observations) and to use classical statistical methods to learn them more deeply (the lack of repetition excludes most analyses based on variance). Unfortunately, it is highly likely that the results obtained for the neural network are the effect of model overfitting, what may be seen in Figures 7-10 (too much adjustment to some data and the inability to reproduce the general relationship). I would like to encouraged the Authors to improve the dataset, revise ANN architecture as I recommended above and repeat procedure of ANN model creating. Please treat this experimental work as a preliminary study of your problem. I will be glad to read the paper again, after improvements.

Some major revisions needed. \r\n\u2022\tThe author described that content of active ingredients of S. miltiorrhiza planted in different regions of the soil environment are different. In my opinion the content of active ingredients not only varies due to some soil factors but also due to environmental factors, altitude, pH of the soil etc. The developed model is based upon soil factors only. Without the environmental factors it is impossible to select the suitable cultivations sites. So if possible develop the model with both soil and environmental factors. \r\n\u2022\tGive voucher no for each collected areas.\r\n\u2022\tAdd the article:   Abdul Akbar, Ananya Kuanar, Raj K Joshi, I S Sandeep, Sujata Mohanty, Pradeep K Naik, Antaryami Mishra, Sanghamitra Nayak (2016) Development of Prediction Model and Experimental Validation in Predicting the Curcumin Content of Turmeric (Curcuma longa L.).

", "The experiment was inappropriately designed for the stated goals and research topic.\r\nThe authors did not define research hypotheses, but briefly mentioned the purpose in the introduction. The introduction is a loose discussion of the problems that were described in the paper. The data obtained from the experiment do not allow the use of most of the used statistical methods and artificial neural networks. In designed experiment 26 data records were obtained from 25 locations.\r\nANN assume learning based on a very large number of responsive data records.\r\nA network model with 8 neurons in input layer, 16 neurons in hidden layer and 7 in output layer was presented. The assumption is correct, but the implementation is not. The number of connections between the input layer and the hidden layer is 128. a minimum of 1280 experimental cases is needed to teach such a network. The authors trained it with 18 samples and verified with 8. This is against the assumptions of the use of ANN.\r\nCorrelation values \u200b\u200bbetween elements and active ingredients were rightly given in the results. Unfortunately, the obtained data do not meet the assumptions of a normal distribution, which the authors ignore in the study. Figures 4 and 5 show that only a few of the studied variables had a distribution that did not differ from the normal distribution for which the correlation method can be used. On the basis of such a small experiment, it is not possible to generalize the relationships and dependencies between the elements in the tested soil and the content of active substances in the plant.\r\nThe authors do not present the source data, but it can be concluded from the description that the only method used correctly was hierarchical cluster analysis. Unfortunately, the methodology does not describe it in detail.

Materials & Methods\n\r\nThe procedure need a bit more explanation.\r\n- In the control condition, did the participants read the book in a separate room so that cats or other pets could not come in?\r\n- For the participants who have more than one cat, did you instruct them which cats they would interact with (e.g., the one kept the longest) ?\r\n- When the participants record their interaction with cats, did they hold the camera (cell phone) by hand? Or did they put it on a tripod or something?\n\r\nMeasures\r\nLine: 223: Participants were asked if they worked the day of interaction. It seems to contradict with the following statement: \"Participants were instructed that on the days they were to participate they were to have been working or performing a work-related task away from their residence for a minimum of 4-hours\" (lines 184-186). \n\r\nLines 231-232: Their stress score was higher on the day of cat interaction than the day of book interaction, is it right?\n\r\nLines 247-249: It would be better to have information about minute sampling in the manuscript as well as in the caption of Table 2.\n\r\nLines 268-269: If the presence of other cats could influence the participants' behavior, why didn\u2019t you control it? Was it impossible to conduct in a room where no other cats could enter?\n\r\nStatistical Analyses \r\nLine 291: I apologize, but I am unsure why you conducted both ANOVA and ANCOVA. Could you please clarify?\n\r\nLines 322-324: A table or figure would be needed.\n\r\nLine 328: If you test whether the mean change from pre to post differed in the two groups, why a t-test was not used? Or, did you conduct 2x2 design ANOVA? Did you mean there were neither main effect of condition (cat / book), order (pre / post) nor interaction of them? Results\n\r\nLines 347-349: In Table 3, \" Conversation with cat, paused for response time \" seems to be negatively correlated with OT change, is that correct?\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nLines 369-370: Do you mean that even if not interacting with the animal, specific behaviors in themselves (for example, petting something) might correlate with OT responses?\n\r\nLines 378-381: Do you mean that an increase in women\u2019s OT would not be expected by interacting with cats in another culture where cats are simply regarded as vermin removers?\n\r\nLines 384-385: There are a few studies about human-cat interactions that did not deal with OT (for example, Edwards et al. (2007) and Nagasawa et al.(2020) mentioned above), so it is better to clarify the differences between those studies..\n\r\nLines 408-410: consider citing Turner (1991, The ethology of the human-cat relationship), which suggested that cat-human interactions last longer when initiated by the cat.\n\r\nParagraphs beginning with Line 421: How about mentioning pet directed speech (PDS)?\n\r\nLines 438-439: \u201ccomparable studies with dogs and children have found effects that were not found in this study.\u201d does this indicate that there was no difference in the change in OT between the cat and control conditions in the present study? While the COVID-19 makes it difficult to conduct face-to-face experiments, it is nice that the participants were instructed how to conduct the experiment so that they could do it alone. As mentioned in the limitation section, this method does not allow you to directly observe the participants interactions, but it is important to continue research and explore new research methods even in such a difficult time.\r\nIt is interesting that women's OT changes were correlated with several behaviors during the human-cat interactions (e.g., positively with petting the cat and cat approach initiation, negatively with cat aggression behavior). However, it does not seem to be much discussion of the reasons why there was no difference in OT change between the control and cat conditions. ", "The methods are reported in good detail. The results are mostly presented clearly, but with an odd framing on the methods. The introduction and discussion are not clearly written, should cite more extensively, and the logical flow is often missing or implicit. I give specific recommendations in the general comments. I also suggest reading sections aloud to help find awkward sentences and shifts in topic. The methods are well reported; however, I have two methodological concerns. \n\r\nFirst, there is no analytical validation (parallelism and spike recovery) reported for samples lyophilized with a 6x concentration. Although another paper is cited for the method, I do not see a validation in that paper either. The kits themselves are validated on unaltered (unconcentrated, not lyophilized samples), however a concentration of 6x could easily concentrate other molecules that might interfere with the immunoassay. Thus, a parallelism should be conducted from above 6x (e.g. 8x) to ensure that the samples dilute in parallel with the standard curve. In addition, spike recovery should be assessed at the 6x concentration. (For more on these methods, see Andreasson et al. 2015.\n\r\nSecond, by taking the differences of already logged concentrations, you are essentially analysing the change ratio, rather than the absolute change in hormone levels. This is important to be clear about in presenting the results and this choice should be justified.\n\r\nAndreasson, Ulf, Armand Perret-Liaudet, Linda J.C. van Waalwijk van Doorn, Kaj Blennow, Davide Chiasserini, Sebastiaan Engelborghs, Tormod Fladby, et al. \u201cA Practical Guide to Immunoassay Method Validation.\u201d Frontiers in Neurology 6, no. Aug (2015): 1\u20138. https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2015.00179. The underlying data is provided, and the conclusions drawn generally seem valid. However, I am concerned regarding the way the correlations with OT change are presented (i.e. not as ratios), and also the mention of COVID-19 in the discussion that is not grounded in any reported data collection. Introduction:\r\n54-55: the use of the word \u201cchanges\u201d makes sense to me as compared to the pre-cat interaction levels, but not relative to the control condition. \r\n60: I am confused by \u201chas establish there are components to behavior on\u201d. Maybe \u201chas identified distinct human and cat behaviors that influence oxytocin release in humans\u201d?\r\n68: I wouldn\u2019t really consider birth (and particularly the physical aspect of contractions facilitated by OT) to be a social behavior. It seems more like a reproductive behavior.\r\n83-84: I agree that this is a more common behavior in humans than other animals, but I\u2019m uncomfortable with the use of unique here. There are certainly plenty of cases, both in the wild and in captivity, of strong bonds between members of different species.\r\n85-86: \u201cDomestic dogs possess social cognitive functions analogous to children\u201d, this is either overclaiming or is open to misinterpretation as such. While dog social cognition does bear some resemblance to human children\u2019s cognition (and it would be worth citing some examples), there are also clearly lots of limitations, and the analogies seem to apply in some respects (or on some tasks) more than others. Please clarify and be more specific.\r\n88-90: What behaviors? Please expand on this. And what do you mean by \u201creflected biologically\u201d other than oxytocin levels? Perhaps this could be simplified by just saying \u201cOxytocin has been implicated in X, Y, Z.\u201d\r\n92-99: this paragraph needs more structure. Guide the reader through your logic.\r\n107: presumably you thought that an unfamiliar cat was meaningfully different from interacting with one\u2019s own cat. Can you be more explicit about that here?\r\n109-115: can you discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? Just a few sentences.\r\nThe introduction generally focuses on the context of maternal behavior. Obviously this is the most relevant to the framing of the study, but it would also be worth mentioning the role of oxytocin in other social relationships, especially pair-bonding.\n\r\nMethods:\r\n148: why was the age of 8 years old chosen as the threshold?\r\n181: missing a word (order? sequence?)\r\n208: interaction, not intervention?\r\n213: were videos set up to capture the interaction (e.g. on a tripod) or held continuously with focus on the cat? How much were the cats in frame? Assuming not the entire time, how was this treated in the behavioral coding and analysis?\r\n267-269: I\u2019m not entirely sure what you\u2019re saying here. Are you trying to get at competition/jealousy between cats? Or split attention of the participant?\r\n273: please provide the catalog number. This is especially important for immunoassays that are dependent on an antibody, which sometimes changes. Please also report the cross-reactivities of this kit with other analytes.\r\nTable 2: are human-initiated and cat-initiated mutually exclusive? What rules do you use to determine? (E.g. what if the human reaches out their hand and the cat pushes their head into it?) \u201cwithin a minute of each minute\u201d I don\u2019t understand (becomes clear later in caption, but this is confusing). Maybe binomial per minute?\r\n288-289: It is more accurate to say \u201cto check normality\u201d, as a failure of Shapiro-Wilk could be for skew or for other reasons (and the test statistic does not tell you about skew).\r\n295-296: subtracting logs is the same as taking the log of division, not subtraction. Thus, you area analysing a change ratio. This is important for the interpretation.\n\r\nResults:\r\nWhile it can be helpful to remind readers what you did (and why) as the beginning of the results, statements about the literature should be in the introduction or discussion, not the results. Furthermore, most of the results are introduced based on the test that produced them. I suggest reframing these sections to focus on the data/result/question, rather than the method. The results would benefit from a figure showing individual points and lines between pre and post. Is the change not large enough to rise to significance, is it there in most but not all individuals, or is it a pretty even mix or rising and falling? A figure that shows this would be helpful for the reader to interpret the negative result.\r\n319: restate this to be about the subjects, not about the data.\r\n324: I think \u201call\u201d refers to across conditions and timepoints, but this is not entirely clear.\r\n342-343: I am confused by this last sentence. Are you extrapolating these results to humans? Why?\r\n348-349: two ands\r\n350: to, not toe?\r\n351: \u201csuggest\u201d or \u201cindicate\u201d not \u201cmean\u201d\r\nTable 3: No indicators of correlation significance are actually given in the table. Instead of flagging certain variables as Y/N sampling indicating a positive correlation, I would suggest the reference level be swapped, which will lead to a more intuitive interpretation of the results.\r\n364-366: explain what you mean by \u201cinconsistent\u201d. Unpack this. While the findings are different, these are pet cats, so that\u2019s not surprising. What might it mean?\n\r\n368-370: I agree that looking at specific behaviors is very important for behavioral endocrinology research!

Figure S2, S3 and S4 are clear, but the x axis starts from a negative value of time and it should be better to start from 0. Moreover, the maximum timescale reached seems to be in only one case 1800 min, while all other graphs stop earlier. Is it possible to have an x scale going from 0 to 2500 min?

What is the main problem and why authors did not solved it? \r\nHowever, methods are correctly described and results are reproducible.\n\r\nThe study of the effect of the ionic strength on the interaction of EGCG with amyloid fibrils is of great interest to understand the effect of drugs on the protein aggregation. Moreover, the competition between ThT, EGCG and ionic strength is of fundamental importance to design new and more effective drugs. In this paper, authors employed a high variety of values for the ionic strength. The novelty of this paper rely on the study of the effect of the ionic strength on the binding of EGCG with amyloid fibrils. Conclusions are supported by results and the high number of replicas, data and controls make the results robust. The conformational changes of insulin is very interesting, but I did not found something similar in literature. Please, check if there are other papers showing that the increase in the ionic strength could alter and in which manner the secondary structure of insulin. Naturally, results regarding the interaction of EGCG with insulin at high ionic strengths should be carefully explained.\n\r\nThe competition of ThT and EGCG is interesting, but a brief discussion at the molecular level based on previous studies should be included.\n\r\nIn the conclusion (line 261), authors should give the value of the optimal ionic strength for the three proteins studied.

(2009) FEBS J. 276, 5960).\r\nThe figure captions need to include the concentration of the peptide/ protein used, not just the concentration of EGCG. This manuscript describes an experimental investigation of the effect of ionic strength (via NaCl concentration variation) on amyloid fibril formation of three common fibril-forming species peptide (amyloid beta) and two proteins (insulin and a-synuclein) in the presence of the well-known polyphenol fibril inhibitor, EGCG. Teasing out an accurate understanding of what is occurring at the molecular level for each of the fibril-forming species, with many variables present, is not easy. Below are suggestions on how to improve the manuscript:\n\r\nLine 92: At what pH were the aggregation experiments conducted with insulin? Presumably, it was acidic, i.e. a pH around 2 as insulin readily forms amyloid fibrils under these conditions.\r\nLine 111: Was amyloid beta 1-40 or amyloid beta 1-42 used for the experiments? The latter aggregates much faster because of the additional two hydrophobic residues. From the relatively short t50 values in the data presented in Figure 3, it would seem to be amyloid beta 1-42.\r\nLine 122: Why were the FTIR spectra acquired in D2O?\r\nWhy were the data for t50 selected for analysis? How about also analyzing the data for ThT fluorescence intensity at the end of the experiment, the time for onset of aggregation (the lag phase) and the initial rate of aggregation (i.e. kinetics of aggregation), which are all standard parameters to investigate inhibition efficiency? The supplementary data show a large amount of variation in the onset of aggregation (i.e. the lag phase) for the three target species in the presence of low concentrations of NaCl (up to ~ 300 mM) but greater consistency above this concentration. What is the explanation for this? Significant variation also occurs in Supplementary Figures 2-4 in the fluorescence intensity at the end of the experiment for all NaCl concentrations.\r\nFor all three fibril-forming species interacting with EGCG, why were the particular ratios chosen, e.g. 25 uM EGCG : 200 uM insulin, i.e. a 1:8 molar ratio? For a-synuclein and amyloid beta, the ratios were very different (1:1 and 1:0.08). How much does EGCG inhibit insulin, a-synuclein and amyloid beta fibril formation at these ratios? The data in the Supplementary Figures 2-4 imply that intermediate levels of inhibition of aggregation by EGCG are present for all three species. This needs to be accurately quantified and compared for all three species in order to interpret the data accurately.\r\nFrom the data presented in all three figures (and the supplementary figures) in the absence of EGCG, amyloid beta aggregates much faster than insulin and a-synuclein, which is most likely a contributing factor to the inefficiency of the EGCG to affect amyloid beta aggregation, unless it is present in large excess. In general, small (e.g. EGCG) and large molecule inhibitors are much more efficient at preventing fibril formation of slowly aggregating species. \r\nIn Figure 3 (amyloid beta + EGCG), why are the data for 0 mM NaCl presented, but they are not reported for insulin and a-synuclein interacting with EGCG? There is little variation in t50 in Figure 3 for all concentrations of NaCl.\r\nLines 195-197: If a-synuclein did not aggregate in the presence of EGCG and no salt, then this implies that EGCG totally inhibited a-synuclein aggregation under these conditions. Importantly for such a conclusion, did a-synuclein aggregate on its own, i.e. in the absence of EGCG and salt?\r\nLines 181-186: In general, EGCG, like other fibril inhibitors, stabilizes an intermediately folded form of insulin (one early on its unfolding, fibril-forming pathway), which is composed of some beta-sheet. It does not have as much beta-sheet as the amyloid fibrillar form which adopts a cross beta-sheet conformation. Consideration should be given in the Discussion of the effect of charge on the three fibril-forming species, i.e. their pI values. Clearly these, along with pH of the experiments, will have a major effect on interaction with Na and Cl ions, particularly for a-synuclein and amyloid beta as they are unstructured entities and therefore their calculated pI values are unaffected by secondary and tertiary structural considerations. Insulin is mainly alpha-helical in its native state but partially unfolds and dissociates from its hexameric form at low pH to facilitate its fibril formation.\r\nLines 281-283 in the Discussion: In general, higher concentrations of NaCl (i.e. higher ionic strength) lead to greater screening of electrostatic interactions between the peptide/ proteins concerned and a consequent shortening of the t50, i.e. promotion of aggregation. At low ionic strength and less consequent screening, repulsion between the peptide/ proteins leads to reduced aggregation, and longer t50 times. ", "The authors do a good job in general of reporting their work which is communicated in good English and with a sensible and logical flow.\r\nOne practical point: please mention both protein and EGCG concentrations (both in mM) in the legends to all figures to allow comparison. 1.\tThe work is critically dependent on the use of plate reader data. I commend the authors for considering positional effects in their plate setup (Fig. S1). Strictly speaking one could randomize it even further but that becomes complicated to administrate. For good measure the authors should describe the design of the plate content (the first and second halves of the plate are identical).\r\n2.\tWhy do the authors use 100 \u00b5M EGCG with aSN and only 25 \u00b5M with insulin and Abeta? This makes it difficult to compare the three proteins. It also raises the thorny issue of concentration dependence in general, i.e. can the effect of salt be overridden by higher [EGCG]? I have some issues with the authors\u2019 interpretations of their results as elaborated in the next section. 1.\tMy main issues relate to the statistical significance of the conclusions drawn from the data.\r\na.\tFig. 2B: I am somewhat skeptical of the conclusions drawn from this figure in view of the relatively large errors (which are inevitable in view of the stochasticity of EGCG effects, cfr. above). At the very least, the authors should subject their values to a more thorough statistical analysis. Currently I would conclude that there is no significant change between values at 100-400 mM NaCl. \r\nb.\tSimilarly, the values in Fig. 3B in my view show similar values at 200-700 mM NaCl; the value at 100 mM is lower but the associated errors make the significance questionable. I disagree with the conclusion that \u201cThe relative t50 values (Figure 3B) followed a similar trend as in the case of alpha-synuclein.\u201d \u2013 unless that trend is revised to say that that there is no trend (which is perhaps a little harsh).\r\nc.\tThe authors state that \u201cThe decreasing t50 values also greatly reduced the stochasticity of spontaneous aggregation, which was quite large at lower ionic strength conditions (Supplementary Figure S2).\u201d This is only the case for EGCG; in the absence of EGCG, the data are (enviably) reproducible at all [NaCl] and this should be clarified. Similar observations are seen in Fig. S3 for alpha-synuclein. It is intriguing that EGCG makes the aggregation process more random at low [NaCl] and the authors are encouraged to speculate on this in the Discussion. \r\n2.\tIn general I am also puzzled by the weak effect of EGCG on aggregation of these proteins. In my experience (admittedly using EGCG that had not been pre-oxidized), 1:1 molar ratios of EGCG are sufficient to suppress aggregation completely. The authors are requested to comment on this. Also, the oxidation change will affect the types of interactions between EGCG and protein. It would have been good to compare with unoxidized EGCG which most researchers use anyway.\r\n3.\tOverall I think it is an important message that EGCG has the greatest effect at low [NaCl] and this is the safest conclusion that can be drawn. The high quality of the ThT time profiles obtained by the authors makes it possible to make more detailed quantitative conclusions. E.g. they should plot t(lag) versus the square root of [NaCl] to check for screening effects and make the appropriate conclusions. \r\nMinor issues:\r\n4.\tThe EGCG oxidation step seems sensible enough, but do the authors have a way to validate the completeness of the oxidation (e.g. by spectroscopy)?\r\n5.\tFig. 1B and 2B: Define the relative t(lag) (ratio between t(lag) with and without EGCG).\r\n6.\tFig. 1CF and 2CF: describe the positions of the two stippled lines representing beta-sheet structures and carbonyl groups (and label them on the graphs).

The method is then validated using two GPCR targets with known crystal structures and demonstrated using another GPCR with no known crystal structure. Overall, the manuscript is relatively well-written and the results are clearly presented. However, the Materials and Methods should be placed after the Introduction and not at the end of the manuscript. In terms of experimental design, I have a few concerns as below:\n\r\n\u2022\tThe choice of two class A GPCR structures to validate the method significantly limits any ability to truly evaluate how the method performs, since class A GPCRs have relatively well-defined binding sites within the TM bundle. While it is true that GPCRs are important drug targets, binding site prediction (the problem the method is intended to solve) is not one limited to GPCRs. The authors should have either use a broader range of targets, or clearly state the limited context in which their results are should be interpreted.\r\n\u2022\tIn Line 354 it is stated that SwissDock poses were manually screened for binding sites located on or near the extracellular site of the protein. This manual intervention does not allow for an objective assessment of ConDockSite\u2019s performance since it introduces a bias (i.e. without this manual intervention would the same results have been achieved?) \u2022\tThe results obtained for the validation targets (\u03b22 and A2A) would be highly dependent on SwissDock results. The results of the COM distance between the predicted pose and the crystal structure pose are reported, but the results obtained from only using SwissDock (without using the conservation scores) should be presented as well in order to allow readers to gauge the degree of improvement afforded by ConDockSite. \r\n\u2022\tSimilarly, for these two targets some comparison with the results of other binding site prediction programs would also be useful, since this is done for GPER but in the case of these two targets the crystal structure is available for comparison. This could be done by either describing the binding site residues identified or using their COM distance. One would expect that for binding site prediction programs the number of binding site residues identified would be larger compared to any approach that utilizes docking as part of the method, although this is somewhat dependent on the size of the ligand as well.\r\n\u2022\tGiven that the authors are presenting a new method, demonstrating the use of the method using a target GPER does not add any value, as there is no way to validate the predictions. Some comparisons with other binding site prediction tools and modelling studies are provided, but these comparisons would inherently not be precise enough to demonstrate that the results are valid. Choosing other targets with experimental data available and discussing it within that context would have been more valuable. If GPER is a target of particular interest to the authors, then some discussion in the context of any available experimental data (e.g. mutagenesis studies) would be useful. If these are not available, then the results are very speculative and should be more clearly indicated as such.\r\n\u2022\tLine 245 \u2013 it is stated that all three methods could identify a binding site roughly similar to ConDockSite. This should be elaborated more clearly in terms of the residues involved in the binding site or the size of the binding site so a proper comparison can be made. The figure provided only allows for a very qualitative assessment of this.\n\r\nOther minor comments:\n\r\n\u2022\tLine 153 \u2013 What is the RMSD between homology models and crystal structures calculated based on?

Homology models were also used to validate the methodology. I would like the authors to address the threshold that can be used to use the method with high confidence as well as the ability of ConDocSite to distinguish between agonists, partial agonists and antagonists among the different classes of GPCRs.

Moreover, looking at the multiple sequence alignment, a high percentage of residues show high conservations, so I would expect a leveling of the ConSurf scores, because it does not seem rare for a ligand to interact with highly conserved residues. In other terms, I think that the major shortcoming of this work is that there is no proof of the advantage in merging SwissScore and ConSurf, because a comparison with these two single scores is lacking. I suggest, as a major revision, to include this kind of analysis as a control, and compare the pose rankings obtained with SwissScore, ConSurf and ConDockSite. Which poses would have been selected for the test cases (crystallographic A2A and \u03b22) if just the SwissScore or the ConSurf score were used? Without this control, the advantage in using the product of the two scores, and the sentence \u201cIncorporating sequence conservation information in ConDockSite overcomes errors introduced from physics-based scoring functions and homology modeling.\u201d at the end of the abstract, are not supported.  The only comparison with different methods has been provided in the case of GPER, but there is no experimental data making this test case a true positive, and, in addition, among the methods that have been compared there is no pure SwissScore nor ConSurf. \r\n-\tLines 167-169: which are the \u201cserious errors in homology modeling\u201d the authors refer to? The RMSD between model and template reported in Table S2 is just 1.8\u00c5 for 5HT2B receptor, comparable or even lower than more successful cases like mu opioid and A2A AR. How can the authors explain the 7.3\u00c5 distance (or RMSD) between predicted and crystallographic ligand? Which are the \u201cserious errors\u201d in the model? Maybe the RMSD between model and crystal structure that was employed is not sufficient to explain 5HT2B model limits? Any thoughts? Or is the depth of the binding pocket the problem? In that case, it would be better to reformulate the sentence.\r\n-\tWhy did the authors employ beta2 and A2A AR for the cross-docking validation, and add mu opioid and 5HT2B just for the homology modeling validation stage? Given the limits of mu opioid and especially 5HT2B models, the authors should add these receptors to the cross-docking validation stage. In this way it will be clear if the problems related to mu opioid and especially 5HT2B are model-related, or instead receptor/binding pocket-related.\r\n-\tLines 169-171: \u201cNevertheless, our results with ConDockSite are consistent with benchmark modeling results that show that GPCR homology models of modest accuracy from templates with low sequence identity are still useful for docking and virtual screening\u201d How can the authors state this? The authors have just shown that the 5HT2B model is for some reason poor (even if it is not clear why) and do not provide good docking results, so how can it be useful for docking and VS?

The article structure is appropriate, in general, but there are some suggestions to improve it, made and marked directly in the document  \n\r\nIn the results and discussion section, I would suggest to describe first the results and then discuss them. Thus, I would suggest moving the first three paragraphs of this section to either the introduction (antecedents/context) or after presenting some results. Revision and reorganization of this section would also allow to avoid repetition of some results, as indicated by specific comments in the document. Several important points are missing or not completely described in the Methods section, particularly those related with the genetic context of the study. This missing information introduces confusion on the genetic interpretation of the results and limits the possibility for replicating the experiment properly. For instance, it is not clear whether the cross between cultivars involved a single-parent cross from each cultivar and the 72 genotypes included in the trial are then full-sibs from a single family. If the cross involved several individuals from each cultivar, then describing the family structure and relationships of the 72 genotypes evaluated would be very useful. Similarly, it is not clear what the authors mean when they mention that \u201csix replications\u201d per genotype were used. How were the genotypes (original parents and the 72 descendant genotypes replicated)? Through their progeny (i.e., sexual propagules) or through clonal replicates (i.e, vegetative propagules). This is an important and crucial issue for interpreting the results, because if the genotypes were actually replicated (either sexually or clonally), then variance components between and within genotypes can be estimated, and, from them, heritability estimates (narrow-sense, broad-sense or clonal repeatability, depending upon the nature of replicates). If so, the authors are missing and excellent opportunity to really address genetic control of traits measured in the study. Otherwise, if genotypes were not really replicated, then the document is dealing only with phenotypic variation within a single full-sib family, and not really evaluating genotypes, nor interpreting genetic variation.  \n\r\nIt should also be described how the parents used in the cross were included in the experimental layout with their progeny genotypes. They are not mentioned in the first paragraphs when describing the experiment set-up. Where they evaluated in separate experiments or were they included in the same experimental layout with their progeny. If so, it would be important to mention how they were replicated in order to have similar age and plant size development as their progeny evaluated.   \n\r\nA more detailed description on the leaf sampling procedure for evaluating morphological and physiological traits would also improve interpretation and understanding of the results. For instance, Chlorophyll Fluorescence and H2O2 measurements were done in the same leaves? Same or different leaves were sampled before and after the stress? Number and position of leaves sampled on each plant? How the environmental factors were controlled while sampling and measuring Chl Fluorescence in the 72 genotypes and replications? The results presented in the manuscript are valid, and they seem to be statistically sound. However some doubts on the statistical and genetic interpretation of results arise from the missing information in the methods section about the procedure used for \"replicating\" the genotypes in the experimental design and trial layout. Clarification on the methodological issues raised would also help to support the conclusions of the study. In my opinion, the manuscript has valuable information, but in its current stage there are some doubts on the genetic context, interpretation and meaning of results. A revised version addressing the methodological issues mentioned above would substantially improve the quality and meaning of the study.    \n\r\nI have made (and marked) several specific comments, questions, and editing suggestions directly on the PDF file of the manuscript, which should be shared with the authors for their benefit in order to be addressed in a new and improved version. ", "Experimental procedures are clear with good acceptable English. Should have provided more references. In few occasion references are missing. Experimental design is good and fit with the aim and scope of the journal. The research questions are not well defined and no rigorous investigation performed. Nothing new is there about the ROS signaling due to stress responses and hence do not possess any novelty. The reactive oxygen species stress mediated by H2O2 is a common phenomenon in plant stress biology that lead to decrease in the photosynthetic rate. It impacts the PS II. So there is nothing new in the manuscript. It is a primitive work and do not bear any extra input to the scientific community that can be useful for the reader. Few of the comments are as follows\r\n1.\tAbstract section: please replace the word \u201csignificance\u201d. Else mention the p value.\r\n2.\tThe H2O2 content generally get increased due to stress thereby decreasing the photosynthetic rate. Higher Fv/Fm is related to higher level of photosynthetic activities (PSII). However, during stress conditions, the Fv/Fm ratio get lowered which is explained in the article. However, there is no phenotypic data to show the stress conditions and percentage of stress incurred to the plants.  \r\n3.\tThe Fv/Fm value range from 0.79 to 0.84 in normal conditions. However, your Fv/Fm value in stressed plants are lower in the case of N4 and in the suitable range in the case of K7. Why it is in the normal range in the case of K7?\r\n4.\tLine 154: please explain the statistical details of the significance. This applicable for all parts of the manuscript.\r\n5.\t Statistical analysis was not conducted for any experiment. ", "I liked the topic of the manuscript. However, the manuscript needs substantial improvement. All sections, introduction, methodology and result/discussion, all need much work in terms of content and also writing. Latest publications are not cited. The flow in writing is weak, needs more work. Detailed comments are provided \"general comments for author\" section\" The manuscript needs to state more clearly the importance and scope of this research in relation to the crop under this study which is missing. The research design looks ok to me. However, I have some concerns related to the pot size that was used to grow the plants for more >80 days. Detailed comments are provided \"general comments for author\" section\" Overall comments:\r\nThe topic of the manuscript is very interesting. But, the manuscript needs further work to improve it. There is a need to add some content, improve the results and discussion section, and further improve the flow in the manuscript.  \n\r\nAbstract section:\r\nGeneral comments: \r\nNeeds improvement. The problem in association with the crop should be stated appropriately. The conclusion should include the implications of the study.\r\nSpecific comments\r\nLine 24: It may be better to write only \u201cbackground\u201d\r\nLine 24 to 25: C3 crops including \u201c\u2026\u201d\r\nLine 27-28: Materials and methods need further improvement. Rewrite it.\r\nLines 29-36: Maybe you can reduce the content on leaf traits to only one sentence considering the results obtained. \n\r\nIntroduction section:\r\nGeneral comments: \r\nThe introduction part does not introduce the crop. There should be at least a small paragraph mentioning the importance of the crop and the need for this particular study. It is also important to provide brief importance of key traits evaluated in association with heat stress in the introduction section. \r\nSpecific comments:\r\nLines 50 to 56: Please include recent climate data if possible. The data presented here is good but almost 15 years old. \r\nLine 71: \u2026cereals including common wheat? \r\nLines 73-75: There are recent studies on heat stress. Please include them and refine this section.\n\r\nMethod section:\r\nGeneral comments:\r\nThe language in the method section needs to be improved. The method should be presented with further clarity. Need some improvement in the flow too.\r\nSpecific comments:\r\nLine 86: Mention \u201cheat tolerant and susceptible\u201d. \r\nLine 86-87: Need to mention when the cross was made. Similarly, in which generation were the 72 lines derived from the cross?\r\nLine 97: 40 days.\r\nLine 99: Need to define Fv, Fm early on. Fo and Fm are defined later in the paragraph but not Fv. \r\nLines 118 to 119: Were the plants that were used in taking destructive samples used in the evaluation of parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics? Not sure but this might have some impact on the assessment. \n\r\nResults and discussion:\r\nGeneral comments:\r\nThe flow of results and discussion need to be improved. I suggest talking about chlorophyll fluorescence in one paragraph, about H2O2 in the other followed by leaf traits. Then, you may want to present the association of these different traits in terms of heat stress tolerance. The discussion part is weak. It needs strengthening with more supporting literature. There may be limited literature available on rye. But similar studies are available for other crops such as wheat.\r\nSpecific comments:\r\nLine 140: Are these kinds of studies still limited? If yes, please include a recent citation. \r\nLines 138 to 153: Some of the information in between these lines may fit better in the introduction section.\r\nLines 188 to 189: What do you mean by \u201cless genetically controlled\u201d?\r\nLines 189 to 194: There are many studies that have indicated the importance of leaf traits in conferring heat tolerance. This study did not show that but it is worth discussing in further depth not only to present the importance of leaf traits but also what other reasons could have led to this result. \n\r\nConclusion section:\r\nIf one of the key findings is that \u201cthe traits under study\u201d are genetically controlled, it should be mentioned that there is a possibility of improving heat/thermal tolerance through breeding. "], "11512": ["The article must be written in English but the authors should improve it avoiding typing errors. \r\nThe authors included a sufficient introduction and background with explanation of own hypothesis. However not revelant literature on  Neuroblastoma  was referenced. I suggest to cite Luksch R et al. 2016. \r\nThe article should be improved in clarity and should be implemented in Methods and Results section with more detailed description of data. \r\nThe hypothesis was not fully sustained by overwhelming results. The authors should provide additional experiments to adequately support own hypothesis. The authors define well the research question, however several past studies provided Neuroblastomas gene expression profiles resulting in a number of gene expression\r\nsignatures being used to evaluate the patient\u2019s risk (De Preter et al., 2010; Oberthuer et al., 2010). Unfortunately, findings derived form these studies have never been translated into clinical practice.\n\r\nThe knowledge gap was identified and the study attempted to fill the gap but I suggest to tone down the wording on the functional consequences of authors' hypothesis. \n\r\nThe investigation seems to be conducted rigorously but not all experiments showed a high technical standard.  \n\r\nMethods were absolutely not described with sufficient information to be reproducible by another investigator. The authors' hypothesis could have a good rationale, but the study needs to be improved in experimental design with adeguate Neruoblastoma risk stratification. It will add value to the literature providing novelty to the actual information on Neuroblastoma.\n\r\nThe data on which the conclusions are based are not robust and nedded to be improved.\r\nThe conclusions are appropriately stated and are connected to the original question investigated. However, the experiments provided do not support adequately the hypothesis. In this study, Yang and co-workers analyzed the molecular differences in the tumour microenvironment between INSS stage 4S and stage 4 examining gene expression microarray data from two public datasets. Biological processes of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were assessed by gene ontology enrichment analysis revealing that 216 DEGs were enriched in aggressive biological processes. The authors highlighted hub genes using STRING database and Cytoscape verifying  gene expression in Oncomine database and found Neuromedin U and neurotensin elevated in stage 4 . To functionally validate in silico findings the authors performed transwell and wound healing assay to explore the function of the genes in neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2). Moreover, they analyzed leukocyte population infiltrating tumour showing a high infiltration of regulatory T cells and type 2 tumour-associated macrophages in stage 4 but not in stage 4S. The authors conclude from their data that neuroblastoma aggressiveness may be associated with the action of neuromedin U and neurotensin in modulating tumour microenvironment and suggest that this information might be used for the development of targeted therapies.\n\r\nSpecific comments:\r\n1. A major limitation of this study is the relatively low number of cases in the two groups of two datasets. Taking also into account that the study has as starting point a re-analysis of public microarray datasets there is a certain risk of over-fitting and over-interpretation of the results. I strongly suggest to validate the results in an independent cohort. This task might be achieved optimally by analyzing another microarray dataset. An example is E-MTAB-161 dataset containing information of 504 NB smaples. Validation of the data in an independent cohort would substantially strengthen the significance of the results.\n\r\n2. In the gene expression microarray dataset examined, the authors extrapoled the gene expression data of stage 4S and stage 4. However, since the high NB tumor heterogeneity as well as clinical outcome, to compare NB patients stage 4 versus 4S could have high risk again in over-interpretation of the results. Do the authors take into account only NB patients stage 4S with disease regression? It is note that patients stage 4S have different outcome according also MYCN amplification.  It would be very interesting to repeat the analysis using stratification risk groups according to the High Risk Neuroblastoma Study 1.7 of SIOPEurope (SIOPEN) specifications considering HR group patients stages 2, 3, 4, and 4S with MYCN gene amplification or stage 4 samples with an age at diagnosis over 12 months of age; \u2018low/intermediate- risk\u2019 (LIR) group the remaining patients. The study would benefit from integrating the performed analysis by adding the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis on Neuromedin U and neurotensin and stage risk.\n\r\nMinor revision\r\n1. In general, the Methods section would be implemented with more detailed on procedure protocols. An example in \u201c6.3 Western blot\u201d control antibody used is lacking as well as information on antibodies incubation time, protein extraction and gel running. The authors would make substantial changes to the manuscript in writing and editing. \r\n2. Same comment for Methods section. The Results section should be expanded and described more comprehensively. \r\n3. In paragraph 2 of Results, the authors explored protein-protein interaction of 216  DEGs. However, the authors should provide the results of the analysis before showing the top 25 hub genes.\r\n4. Paragraph 3 of Results. The study would benefit from sharpening the hypotheses on NB tumour progression. I suggest changing the last sentence since NB tumour progression don\u2019t\u2019 follow the roles of Vogelstein \u201cmultistep tumour model\u201d.  It is not very clear as CIBERSORT works, please provide more detailed since from this analysis the authors based own speculations.\r\n5. Paragraph 4 of Results. The authors showed western blot of two proteins of interest. However, the two proteins are both of 20 kDa. Did the authors incubate the antibodies on the same membrane? If, yes, they should run protein lysate so that they can incubate the full membrane with two antibodies in parallel, without stripping. Moreover, the authors should show the effects of silencing on RNA. I suggest to perform RT-PCR.\n\r\n6. The authors should support own hypothesis on the role of Neuromedin U and neurotensin in tumour aggressiveness with additional functional tests, such as clonogenic assay.\n\r\n7. Conclusion. I suggest to tone down the wording on the functional consequences of genes of interest, and even more on their potential significance as therapeutic targets.\n\r\n8.

", "In this manuscript, Yang and coworkers describe the molecular differences in the tumour microenvironment (TME) between Neuroblastoma INSS stage 4S and stage 4. The work is presented quite well and shows that Neuromedin U (NMU) and neurotensin (NTS) were elevated in stage 4. The authors also demonstrate that NMU and NTS promoted the proliferation and invasion of SK-N-BE(2) cell. Lastly, the authors showed a high infiltration of regulatory T cells and type 2 tumour-associated macrophages in stage 4 but not in stage 4S. However, there is no direct link here to show a relationship between NMU /NTS and TME. Overall this is an interesting piece of work, but much work needs to be done to improve the robustness of the findings.\r\n1.\tPlease could the authors check the manuscript throughout for grammatical errors as there are sentences which do not make sense.\r\n2.\tThe introduction needs to be improved.

As for the Materials and Methods section, the Results need to be better described. The authors state that NMU and NTS may be implicated in the modulation of TME and neuroblastoma development, however, this hypothesis was not fully supported by results. \r\n1.\tIn supplementary Table 2 the authors reported the 25 hub genes screened by CytoHubba ranked by Degree method, could they also report the genes obtained after combination with the Oncomine database? Furthermore, could the authors comment on why NMU and NTS were selected for further validation?\r\n2.\tIn \u201c3. Significant tumour-associated lymphocytes infiltration occurred in stage 4\u201d section it is shown that tumour-associated macrophages type 2 (TAM-M2) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) were significantly infiltrated in stage 4, but there is no direct link here with NMU and NTS expression. The authors should discuss the possible causes this.\r\n3.\tThe \u201c4. NMU and NTS promote cell proliferation and invasion of SK-N-BE(2)\u201d section needs to be improved. First, cell proliferation and migration are different concepts. Wound healing experiments can indicate the cell migration while the BrdU assay, MTT assay or Ki67 may be used to analyze cell proliferation. Furthermore, no statistical tests have been conducted to support the effect of downregulation of NMU and NTS on cell migration.

It is a very interesting paper, but I have some concerns about the specificity of knockdown using Cas-9. There is a high homology between CCT6B and the others CCTs, and probably targeting the exon 4 of CCT6B may also affect the other CCTs. If exon 4 sequence is CCT6B-specific I suggest to carry out an alignment of sequences demonstrating the specificity. This alignment can be inserted as supplementary figure. In fig. 8, it is speculative to state that downregulation of CCT6B induces downregulation of CCT4 and CCT7 because the possible unspecificity of knockdown and several times the protein expression may not accompaign the mRNA expression.\r\nAlso, it is not clear the knockdown of CCT6B.

Still, there are two major issues with the results that the authors should clarify:\r\n1 - The data presented in figure 1D is not clear to us (even considering the raw data provided). The control protein GAPDH band intensity in Cct6b-/- animals is lower than in the Cct6b+/+; does this mean that the loading is inferior in this lane and explains the absence of the CCT6B band? What is the band above Cct6b? Why is the antibody recognizing this band? What are the remaining bands presented in the raw data blot for CCT6B? How sure are the authors that no CCT6B protein is expressed and hence that the KO experiment was completely successful?\r\n2 - On the data provided in Figure 7 about the decrease in the expression of Cct4 and Cct7 in the absence of Cct6b. The decrease is residual when compared to controls. What is the biological significance of this decrease? Does it translate at the protein level? The authors should discuss/explain this. Furthermore, what is the similarity in the sequence between these Cct4 and 7 genes compared to Cct6b? In the introduction, the authors indicate an overall 30% identity. Is it possible that the 5bp deletion designed for Ccct6b affects the Cct4 and 7 genes?\n\r\nThis and other aspects should be further explained and explored in the discussion section, which is short and misses relevant aspects.

The authors need to correct this. Method section: Detection of van genes and virulence genes is mentioned twice (Line 134-157) The authors mentioned that year 2014 had the highest number of VRE isolates which is correct but the reason for its selection is wrong. The authors compared the number of VRE isolates in 2014 (28) to the total number of VRE isolates i.e. 90. The authors need to actually compare the VRE(%)  in table 1. The fact that the year 2014 had the highest percentage (4.3%) of VRE positive strains makes this year with the highest prevalence of VRE. \n\r\nThe same thing also applies while comparing other characteristics. For eg., when comparing the gender ratio, the number of VRE isolates is higher in females than in males, and this may be because of more sampling from females compared to males. The current study monitors the prevalence of drug-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a tertiary care hospital in Southern Thailand. This is an important study that is well performed and written and the results are discussed in detail. \n\r\nComments:\r\n- Antimicrobial resistance profiles: The  authors need to explain why all the 90 VRE isolates were not tested against different antibiotics \r\n- As mentioned in the above section, the authors need to also consider the total number of isolates when comparing different characteristics such as year, gender, age, source, and hospital unit ", "The paper is well written, straightforward, and easy to read.

If you like to see the biological response to the pH drift from the physiological equilibrium, why didn't you exclude them and just focus on 153 non-ventilated infants?  Especially if you want to move on your next study based on the current study results, then you had better do so. \r\n\uf06c\tAccording to the cord blood pH, the severity of general status of your study population did not seem to be less, because they were almost within normal ranges.

Too difficult to follow with no correlation to the clinical conditions of the babies categorised to the reasons they were admitted in the first place. These infants are not representative of the normal population unless their underlying conditions are clearly spelt out. Flawed. These are not normal spontaneously breathing infants but were sick and on the road to recovery. Spontaneously breathing infants not mechanically ventilated do not equate healthy infants. I find it difficult to accept the conclusion when there was no mention at all about the underlying disease particularly any residual lung disease, the respiratory rate, temperature - these could impact on hyperventilation, low CO2 and therefore higher pH in the sicker infants initially who are recovering.

How were the units of fluorescence correlated with the number of living worms? Was the increase in fluorescence due to more live worms, or due to oxidative stress? \r\n9. How to explain that MWCNT + glucose gives an increased fluorescence of recombinant worms (Fig. 10), while glucose in the fungal cultivation medium suppresses the activity of the studied enzymes (Fig. 2)? According to the authors, these enzymes modifying MWCNTs and increasing their toxicity (line 380-383) which leads to oxidative stress and increased fluorescence of the worms. It is worth discussing these results in more detail.

Some references not found in text - check all ", "In the Introduction section, the authors focused on the medicinal value of the genus Smilax, but did not introduce the reason why DNA barcodes are needed for its identification. Perhaps it is difficult to separate it from its closely related species based on the morphological characteristics? In addition, what methods have been used for the identification of this genus? The author can elaborate on the above issues in more detail. - The Smilax genus consists of 310 species, but the authors only analyzed one of them (Smilax purhampuy). What is special about this species?\r\n- Very limited number of specimens were analyzed in this study.\r\n- Where does the \u201cpowder drug of the rhizomes\u201d (Line 112) come from?\r\n- When constructing a phylogenetic tree, bootstrap replicates is generally set to 1000 to make the results more reliable. - For the same species, it is strange that the lengths of the amplified sequences from the same marker vary greatly (Data_S1). Before the blast analysis and alignment, it is necessary to cut the sequences from the same marker with a uniform standard to avoid false positives. The sequence length of different barcodes should be mentioned in Results section. Correspondingly, the results of the phylogenetic trees also need to be updated. \r\n- \u201cSmilax samples\u201d and \u201csamples of Smilax\u201d in Results section should clearly refer to Smilax purhampuy. Please revise thoroughly. \r\n- After comparing all the barcodes in this study, the author should conclude which barcode is the most effective for identifying Smilax purhampuy. The discussion of candidate barcode selection for Smilax purhampuy or Smilax genus should be enriched. -This work reported the micromorphological characteristics and the molecular barcodes of Smilax purhampuy collected in Ecuador. The most prominent problem lies in sample size and pre-processing of data, which need to be improved and modified.\r\n-The English language should be further improved. ", "I believe that both the literature review on molecular methods, the description of results and the discussion of part concerning barcode analysis require improvement and extending. \n\r\n1. I would advise to enrich the Introduction with an outline of the phylogenetic and taxonomic knowledge of the genus Smilax. Has any phylogenetic research been conducted on this genus? If so, it is also worth referring to them in the Discussion.\n\r\n2. I think it is worth to mention that presently in GenBank database there are only few complete genomes of Smilax published, namely: four genomes representing three species. The methodology applied in the study would be also more transparent if the Authors state it clearly, that plastomes of other Smilax species which appear in The Results as blastn hits are not published as complete genomes but only chosen genes are sequenced and deposited in GB. It should be explained to the reader that the results of the blastn analysis showing similarity to a given species are based on the incomplete database.\n\r\n3. The Authors should also explain why it was not possible to conduct a barcoding-gap analysis, or to use automated species identification such as Spider, SpeciesIdentifier or FASTACHAR, routinely used in studies concerning barcodes. What I mean is the fact that for these kind of analyses more than one representative for each species is needed. In this study S. purphampuy is represented by three samples collected for this study but the Genbank database unfortunately does not provide multiple representatives within species taken into comparison.\n\r\n4. In my opinion, the results would definitely become more readable if one or several of the best-developed trees were presented in the main article body and not in a supplement. Instead, table 1 could be moved to supplementary information.\n\r\n5. The best blastn hits described in the Results in lines 170-178 could be successfully presented in Table 2 by bolding the highest results. I think In the text The Authors should emphasize the most important results, e.g.: that the rpoC1 gene didn\u2019t discriminate species within Smilax genus at all. I would also mention that the use of matK as a barcode didn\u2019t discriminate S. purphampuy from S. fluminensis. The variability of rbcL sequence is also worth discussing. The identity of rbcL sequences in this study was always over 99%, however it is not known whether this was due to interspecies variation, or also largely to variation within species. The latter possibility would be indicated by the result of the ML analysis, which does not group Smilax species into species-specific clades. 1. In lines: 31 and 81 the Authors stated that morphological and molecular barcode analysis S. purphampuy are lacking in Ecuador. Have they been made in any other country? The reader may doubt whether the research is innovative in a given area or for the species at all.\n\r\n2. Please emphasize the fact that there is little molecular data on Smilax available, what will emphasize the novelty of this work and at the same time dispel the reader's doubts about the correctness of the methodology used in the study.\n\r\n3. The valuable information which I lack in Conclusion is an indication of which barcode or barcodes best identify species of the genus Smilax. The manuscript entitled \u201cMolecular barcode and morphological analysis of the medicinal plant Smilax purphampuy Ruiz collected in Ecuador\u201d presents the results of the study on the representative of Smilaxaceae family. The studied species gained the attention of the Authors of the research because of its usage in folk medicine and because of the lack of morphological and barcode analysis for S. purphampuy in the literature. \r\nThe subject of the research is in line with the current research trends, and the problem undertaken in the research is absolutely justified. The manuscript describes the research conducted in two ways. Some of them concern morphological research, the other part molecular analysis. I do not feel like an expert in the field of morphological research, although both the methods used seem to me to be reasonably selected and presented, and the description of the obtained results is understandable, clear, consistent and exhaustive. This part gives the impression of being well thought out and thoroughly conducted. Regarding the description of research conducted with molecular methods, I have a few comments. The laboratory methods themselves are well selected and described and do not raise my concerns. \r\nI hope that questions and detailed comments on specific chapters listed in my review will help to improve the manuscript.\n\r\nBelow minor comments to the manuscript are listed:\r\nPlease, standarize the nomenclature of genes \u2013 relates to the use of italics in gene names.\r\nLine 51: \u201e\u2026 therefore, the taxonomy classification of Smilax was confirmed\u201d \u2013this conclusion goes a little bit too far and is a bit of a oversimplification.\r\nLine 133 \u2013 should be sequenced instead of sequence\r\nLine 134 \u2013 Replace sequences with the word sequenced\r\nLine 139 \u2013 Please, replace sequences with sequence\r\nLine 141 \u2013 I don\u2019t understand, what number did the Authors wanted to mention in brackets? "], "11085": ["The manuscript is clear and unambiguous, with a few grammatical and spelling errors that need to be corrected before acceptance.\n\r\nThe authors have cited relevant literature; however, some important references addressing sex differences in isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction are missing e.g. the work of Angela Woodiwiss group. Also the reference Grant et al. 2020 should be updated to the published peer-reviewed article, instead of the preprint version.\n\r\nArticle is structured professionally with relevant data shared. The primary research focus is within the scope of the journal.\n\r\nThe manuscript addresses an important gap in knowledge. The global effect of chronic isoproterenol administration on the heart has been reported previously, but reporting the segmental effects of isoproterenol is new. The authors addressed this gap in knowledge rigorously and described their methods in sufficient details. Data presentation and interpretation:\r\n1- The tables should show the interaction p value in addition to the Sex and Iso effects.\r\n2- It seems that isoproterenol increased the LV mass in male mice only (from 86 to 95 mg, almost a 10% increase). Although this was not significant with this sample size and high variability, this needs to be addressed. \r\n3- The data and the statistical analysis in Figure 1 do not address the sex differences. The data for each segment should be compared between males and females in parallel and the Two-Way ANOVA should be used here, similar to the Tables. Sex differences cannot be properly addressed without Two-Way ANOVA.\r\n4- The authors used the Pre- to Post- comparison in the Figures, in contrast to the Tables where the used control vs. treatment. There should be an explanation. \r\nDiscussion and Conclusions:\r\nThe Discussion has a lot of repetitions from the Results section. The authors should use the Discussion to compare their findings with prior research and critically evaluate/speculate on the differences and similarities. In general, the manuscript advances this particular area of research by showing segment-specific differences in the response to isoproterenol. The major limitation, as stated by the authors, is the lack of any tissue-driven data e.g. molecular markers of remodeling, histopathology,...etc. It is not hard to repeat the mouse experiments for the purpose of obtaining these tissues (these are regular C57Bl/6J mice, not very expensive). Without these tissue-level data, this reviewer thinks that the amount of data in this manuscript commensurate with a short communication, not a full length article. ", "The author gave a clear and straightforward background introduction. The structure of this manuscript is professional. The results provided by the author was almost self-contained. But some sentence in the manuscript is a little bit confusing, like \"Anterior segments were also reduced in females.\". Please revise them and give more detailed descriptions. The author continuously infused the mice with ISO for 3 weeks and found that there were decreased systolic and diastolic cardiac function and there was a gender difference. The research design was good and the description of the methods was detailed enough. According to the results, the author found that the strain analysis could identify regions of LV that was more negatively affected by ISO. They also mentioned that continuously infused the mice with ISO could build a model for Takosubo cardiomyopathy. \r\nAll underlying data have been provided and conclusions are well stated. 1. The range for HR (400-550 BPM) is relatively large. Please provide the HR for speckle tracking analysis (male and female, before and after ISO). HR might also affect the strain and strain rate.\n\r\n2. Please provided the BW and/or TL corrected LV wall thickness, LV diameter/volume, CO, and SV, which would make the data more persuasive for mice with significantly different BW.\n\r\n3. How about the systolic and diastolic cardiac function when using the ISO (before stop)? Did the systolic function increase or decrease after continuously infusing the ISO after 1 week, 2 weeks, or 3 weeks?\n\r\n4. Have any other experiments been done to prove the decrease of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, like hemodynamic analysis?\n\r\n5. When doing the speckle tracking analysis, please provide the time to peak for strain and strain rate and the standard deviation of time to peak for different segments. This parameter is critical for evaluating cardiac synchronization and represents the systolic function as well. The asynchrony could be proved in videos S1 and S2.\n\r\n6. The intra- and inter-observer variability should be added for both speckle tracking and conventional echo analysis.\n\r\n7. In line 106, the author mentioned that \u201c2D echo B-mode loops were acquired from the LV PSLAX\u201d. Should it be \u201cPSLAX and SAX\u201d?\n\r\n8. In line 182, the author mentioned that \u201csometimes showed features of an infarct in the posterior wall near\u201d. Please give more description about that, and please provide more evidence, like ECG, for infarction, if possible.

The echo recordings are of high quality and the animal model seems well maintained and may have clinical relevence. \n\r\nThe mice were not euthanised and so no morphological or biochemical data were collected. \n\r\nThe research described are interesting, but very similar in nature to those of Grant et al 2020. That paper used a mouse ISO infusion model for 14 days in female and males. They find functionally similar differences in both sexes. \n\r\nGrant et al conclude that mice do not replicate the sexual dimorphism of humans and so may not be a relevant model for the disease. There may be a slight reduction in ejection fraction, but this was opposite to human, where males were are more severely affected. \n\r\nIt is unclear therefore what additional information is gained by this study. The data are of high methodological quality, are analysed to a high standard data and are statistically valid. The animal model seems to replicate that previously published.

The manuscript is nicely written, with clear and professional English language. Introduction is clear and it provides a nice of overview of the issues shown in the manuscript, and the number of references used is adequeate. Figures and tables are relevant, and appropriate for an adequate discussion. The research shown in the manuscript is original, and it fits with the Aims and Scope of the Journal. Research questions are well defined to fill an identified knowledge gap, and authors carry out a nice investigation to answer it. \n\r\nNevertheless, I found authors should explain some of the methodological decisions taken during their investigation:\n\r\n-\tMy main criticism deals with the mapping approach used, since their experimental approach (the genetic analysis of a biparental cross) seems more adequate to perform a classical QTL mapping study (via linkage map construction and QTL analysis) than the MLM method used in this work. Authors should discuss the reason of this choice, and how this method might have affected the results shown in the manuscript. Ideally, authors should perform a classical QTL mapping analysis to compare if their approach is equivalent to the one shown in the manuscript. \n\r\n-\tThe second issue I would like to remark is the use of two genomes for reads alignment. Although the advantage is clear (and it is stated in lines 254-256), it is not clear if authors compared and merged the SNPs detected with these genomes (to construct a consensus dataset with common and specific SNPs), or if they conducted MLM association tests with both datasets in an independent way, which in turn will cause some redundancy in the results shown in the manuscript (see Tables 4 and 5). If that is the case, authors should show the number of common SNPs detected using both genomes, which should be high according to the findings of Genova et al., 2014 and Patel et al., 2018. \n\r\n-\tRelated to the previous comment, did authors discard SNPs mapped the ChrUnk for MLM association tests? (they are not present in the Manhattan plot figure).\n\r\n-\tAlso related to the previous comment, authors should discuss the different number of SNPs detected in the VxT progeny when using PN40024 or Thompson Seedless genomes for alignment. \n\r\n-\tAn important point is the low number of markers obtained after GBS. Authors report the detection of \u201conly\u201d 10K/4K SNPs in a Vitis vinifera x Vitis vinifera progeny of 249 offsprings. Recent works report denser datasets. As an example, Tello et al. 2019 report the detection of an average of 17K SNPs in a series of progenies of 60 individuals. Do authors have any reason for such low efficacy? Did authors include Verdejo and Traminer in the GBS approach? \n\r\n-\tSome other detected issues include:\n\r\no\tAbstract, line 21. Substitute Vitis for Vitis vinifera L. It applies to the rest of the document. \r\no\tThe term GWAS should be avoided in the document, as it is used for the genetic analysis of core collections or diversity panels (see line 213, as an example).\r\no\tLine 361: genic \u201cdeserts\u201d. Do authors mean intergenic regions?\r\no\tLines 378-380. Verdejo Blanco is not the grandson of Traminer. Verdejo Blanco is a direct offspring of Traminer (Castellana Blanca x Traminer). See: http://www.vivc.de/index.php?r=passport%2Fview&id=12949\r\no\tTable 1. Authors found higher concentration levels for most nutrients than the expected \u201cnormal\u201d range. Although it can be due to transgressive segregation, did authors analyse nutrients concentration in Verdejo and Traminer?\r\no\tTables 4 and 5. The likely role of these genes on the associated trait should be further discussed in the manuscript. GBS are not available and bioinformatic scripts have not been provided (at least, it is not indicated in the manuscript). Authors should solve this issue. ", "Manuscript from Naegele et al. uses GWAS and identifies SNPs associated with magnesium and sodium uptake and the effect of their accumulation on micro and macronutrient levels in Vitis vinifera. It is a well-written manuscript and presents some useful data for the grape breeding and genetics community so I suggest it should be accepted for publication. However, before its acceptance authors should address some concerns. \n\r\nI did not find a strong rationale for selecting some micro and macronutrients in the study. I would have loved to see authors talking about it from a biofortification perspective. The authors should focus little more to explain why they selected these 4-5 micro/macronutrients. \n\r\nThese variations in the correlation between the data collected from two different years. For example authors  reported \u201c Foliar symptoms were consistent (\u2265 90%) between years and correlated with changes in nutrient concentrations of magnesium (r = 0.65 and r = 0.38 in 2015 and 2016,respectively), aluminum (r = 0.24 and r = 0.49), iron (r = 0.21 and r = 0.49), and sodium (r= 0.32 and r = 0.21)\u201d. I see huge variations in the correlation data between the years. How do authors explain these variations?\n\r\nAuthors have used terms such as Sodium-associated SNPs, I am very critical of such descriptions. Authors should at least mention whether or not these SNPs are associated with higher or lower sodium / or another micro/macronutrient concentrations. It will provide a smooth reading to their audiences. ", "This manuscript reports a genome-wide phenotype-genotype association study for traits related to plant mineral nutrition in a bi-parental population of cultivated grapevine. Provided that ion measurement protocol is valid (which I cannot assess because I am not a physiologist), this study is sound, producing a large amount of simultaneous results on the genetic variation and determinism of several ions content, with rigorous analyses and interpretation of results. However, it suffers from some weaknesses, which are listed below. Therefore, I recommend major changes to be made before acceptance.\n\r\nOn the whole, the manuscript is written in a clear, unambiguous, professional English language, but it still has to be double-checked to correct some small errors (e.g. lines 224 : 2015 written twice ; 236 : one genes ; 237 : which are a class ; 264 : on chromosome 3, 4, etc).\n\r\nThe context is well described in the Introduction. However, the reporting of previous QTL studies lacks precision: \r\nLines 88-91, formulation is unclear (\u201capproximately\u201d should be \u201cup to\u201d, important precisions such as \u201cinter-specific cross\u201d, \u201cas rootstock\u201d and \u201cunder chlorosing conditions\u201d should be added, and many more small QTLs were found than stated).\r\nLine 94: should be \u201cHenderson et al 2018\u201d and \u201cthe author characterized the proteins encoded by 4 alleles of a gene\u201d.\r\nLines 87-98: all three studies were on inter-specific crosses, which should be stated.\n\r\nStructure conforms to PeerJ standards, except that \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section has \u201cMethods\u201d as title, there is no \u201cConclusions\u201d section, and no separate \u201cFunding statement\u201d section.\n\r\nMain figures are relevant and high quality, but Figure 2 is not cited in the text and its legend lacks some precisions (remove \u201cfoliar\u201d and define the horizontal line). Add \u201cvinifera\u201d to the legends of both figures. Supplemental Figures are not very well explained. Supplemental Figure 1 does not show the same list of ions as mentioned in the text lines 197-198. Supplemental Figure 2 has no legend at all. For marker-trait associations, Manhattan plots should be provided for all traits analysed as Supplemental Figures, for both genomes, in addition to Figure 2.\n\r\nRaw data are not supplied. This manuscript reports original primary research within the scope of the journal.\n\r\nThe research question (genome regions associated with variation in grapevine leaf micronutrient content) is well defined, relevant, and meaningful. Correlation between nutrients and deficiency symptoms is extensively discussed, therefore it should also appear in the research question. How this research fills a knowledge gap (on joint genetic variation and determinism of several nutrients in grapevine) should be more clearly stated in the introduction.\n\r\nRigorous investigation was performed to a high technical and ethical standard (as far as genotyping and statistical analyses are concerned). The authors chose to detect QTLs with GWAS instead of interval mapping, as usually done in bi-parental populations. This interesting strategy is made possible by the high marker density reached by next generation sequencing methods. It requires no preliminary genetic mapping, and therefore makes it more straightforward to detect correlations with SNPs found with different reference genome sequences. The advantages of this strategy could be emphasized in the manuscript, and its potential limits (uneven marker genome coverage) discussed. \r\nA few minor issues on methods are:\r\nLine 139: Pearson\u2019s correlations on raw or transformed variables? If on raw variables, then rather use Spearman, since raw distributions were not normal.\r\nLine 151: why was read length trimmed at 20 bp? This seems very short compared to usual read length (100-150 bp).\r\nLine 157: a depth threshold of 5 is very small for a heterozygous species such as grapevine; it could lead to inflated genotyping error rates. This should at least be discussed as a potential limit of the study, since no genetic mapping was performed, which would allow to remove markers with genotyping problems.\n\r\nAt many places, methods are not described with sufficient detail:\r\nLines 119-120: the time and way these nutrients were applied should be described in more details, according to what is stated lines 44-46.\r\nLine 122-123: it is not clear here whether symptoms were measured separately or combined (it is clear only later, at lines 134-135).\r\nLine 124: more details are needed on the number of leaves taken per vine and their development stage, according to what is stated at lines 291-292. In particular, was leaf sampling done exactly the same way in both years?\r\nLine 125: it is not clear here if on the 249 offsprings or on the subsets described in the preceding sentence.\r\nLine 125: air dried: at which temperature and how long?\r\nLine 126: the methods used to quantify each ion are not given here, whereas it is a key point for this study. Please detail, or at least give method names and references. In addition, please explicit whether there were any controls and/or replicates.\r\nLine 133: the statistical method used for testing normality should be given.\r\nLine 134: precise what effect was tested in ANOVA.\r\nLine 137: differences in nutrient concentrations between what?\r\nLine 139: Ward method: which software, version and parameters?\r\nLines 140-142: not clear at all (\u201cmean square values across years\u201d); please give the page referred to in Fehr 1987, and explicit the formula used for calculating heritability.\r\nLine 148: which enzyme?\r\nLines 148-149: give a reference for the protocol.\r\nLine 153: replace \u201cPinot noir\u201d by \u201cPN40024\u201d throughout the text.\r\nLines 159-161: was association with SNPs tested for all ions measured? It is not clear because distribution and correlation results are given for all 13 ions (Supplemental Table 1), but QTL results are given only for Mg and Na (Supplemental Table 3). Please state here explicitly and complement results and discussion if need be.\r\nLine 156: \u201cusing a reference genome\u201d: not clear; do you mean \u201cbetween reference genomes\u201d?\r\nLine 160: give Tassel version.\r\nLine 166: give Blast2GO version and NCBI database versions. All analysis results underlying conclusions have been provided. Many valuable results are shown. However, additional results of interest could easily been shown and a few points have to be made concerning results presentation.\r\n- Plots and correlations between years are not shown. \r\n- Authors could also easily estimate BLUPs of genotypic values for all offsprings, after fitting a mixed linear model with genotype as random effect and year as fixed effect (phenotype = genotype + year + error). This would allow them to study genetic correlations between traits.\r\n- Raw distributions of traits should be given as supplementary figures and commented.\r\nLines 158-159: only the total number of SNPs is given. Since no genetic map is produced, the physical distribution of these markers along the genome should be shown, for the reader to assess genome coverage quality.\r\nLine 191-192: it is not clear why heritability is not estimable for these ions? Given the experimental design, heritability should be estimable for all ions quantified.\r\nLines 197-210: correspondence between text and Tables should be double-checked in this paragragraph: \r\n- Line 199: r up to 0.6146 and 0.4805, not >=\r\n- Lines 199-200: no for Al, OK for Mg\r\n- Line 206: in 2015, not 2016\r\n- Line 207: S P K in 2015, not in 2016\r\n- Line 208: not true in 2016\r\n- Lines 208-210: P/K not in Supplemental Table 2; also comment other ratios\r\nFor marker-trait associations, please give in text the total number of significant SNPs for each trait from the start (e.g. line 225: 21 SNPs), and try to more clearly highlight overlaps between years and between genomes (Manhattan plots, as required, would be helpful).\r\nLines 251-268: not very clear; more clearly separate results on stunting vs combined, and on significant SNPs vs significant SNPs in genes.\n\r\nConclusions given are generally well stated, linked to original research question and limited to supporting results. However, a few issues should be addressed and several additional points should be discussed, given the results:\r\n- Discuss differences between years both in ion concentrations, correlations, and SNPs associated (more in 2016): could they partly be due to differences in nutrient supply between years? And/or to genotype x year interactions?\r\n- Discuss low heritability values: could they partly be due to methods (leaf sampling, precision of ion quantification methods)?\r\n- Present results have been obtained in a pure V. vinifera population; discuss what differences this may make with previous works on inter-specific crosses? What is the impact on mineral nutrition of studying offsprings as seedlings/cuttings vs as rootstocks?\r\n- Line 295: the results of Bates and Wolf 2008 are used as reference by the authors; please discuss to what extent they are comparable to your own data (plant management? Sampling procedure? Measurement method?).\r\n- Lines 349-350: results were compared with other GWASs but allele frequencies are not comparable between bi-parental populations and diversity panels\r\n- Line 369: year effect might be due not only to age, but also to environment or genotype x year interactions. \r\n- Line 374: in bi-parental populations, confidence intervals are large due to large extent of linkage disequilibrium, and therefore they harbor many candidate genes.\r\n- Line 381-382: not clear; segregation distortion could easily be tested along the genome (physical positions) for this population.\r\n- Line 384-385: to clarify relationships between symptoms and nutrients, binary regression of symptoms on nutrients could be performed. PCA of nutrient contents (in each year and/or with inter-year genotypic BLUPs) may also help clarifying the relationships between these traits.

Also, the figure legends refer to Figure 2(a) and 2(b) but I see six panels. \n\r\nFigure 3, bottom panel on the left \u2013 Why does the model deviate so strongly from the experiments? \n\r\nLine 118 \u2013 I think the words \u2018assumed to be\u2019 are missing, i.e., the sentence should read \u2018\u2026they are assumed to be more sensitive to depletion\u2026\u2019. This is a (very reasonable) modeling assumption based on the experimental finding that cancer cells consume more Gln than healthy cells. \n\r\nLine 123 \u2013 What are the different concentrations? \n\r\nTable 3 \u2013 Should r1CC be 5.99x10^-2 h^-1?  The notation of using a dot to denote multiplication is confusing with decimals also present. Consider switching to \u2018x\u2019. ", "This is a mostly well-written paper, lacking in details in some sections, that adequately describes the current state of the literature. There could be more focus on models of mono- and co-cultures and their interactions in cancer contexts, including, for example, doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01174-3, 10.1007/s00109-017-1587-4, and 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007278. Figure 1A (left panel) can be improved. Instead of marking individual points for triplicates, suggest indicating error bars. Raw data is supplied. Overall, the experimental design is adequately described. It is unclear to me why numerical simulations were carried out in Mathematica but fitting was done in Matlab, when you would need to implement the model in Matlab to be able to solve it in an optimizer? This shouldn't impact on the results but is curious. A clearer statement of the conclusions could be provided, the discussion reiterates much of what is said as background and context in the introduction. I question how generalizable and valid the results are given the very poor fits to co-culture experiments. Suggest that a sequential fitting procedure could be better adapted and more logical (though details of how each parameter fit was obtained are scarce). 1) Lines 110-111: What is the rationale for choosing an initial concentration of 20nM? Is this due to experimental conditions or prior knowledge? Either should be stated.\n\r\n2) In all tables, it appears all of the model parameters are fit. Can no prior knowledge be incorporated to reduce the number of parameters? What about using a sequential fitting scheme to fit a reduced number of parameters and then build in others? Perhaps this was done but details were not provided.\n\r\n3) Lines 118-119: A reference for this statement would be good to provide.\n\r\n4) Overall, I would suggest using more identifiable variables in the model (this doesn't impact on the mathematics but makes it easier for readers to follow the equations). Also the choice of e as a parameter is not a good one as it looks like an exponential function.\n\r\n5) Why is no direct interaction between CAF and cancer cells assumed in the model? This seems questionable to me, and I think the lack of this interaction is related to the poor model fits to co-cultures. See, for example, doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007278. Later on lines 125-126, the authors state: \"the growth rates of both cell types are allowed to change since in the co-culture it is assumed that the two cell types may affect each other\" but this only modelled indrectly.\n\r\n6) The discussion can be greatly improved. Lines 152-166 don't belong in a discussion. There is a lack of focus communicating the outcome of the study.\n\r\n7) Lines 181-190: As stated earlier, the model may be missing important interaction terms that could be leading to these poor fits.\n\r\n8) Line 234: A better understanding of the interactions of the model could be obtained by varying the initial proportions of cells. What is the rationale for sticking to 1:1 only?\n\r\n9) \"Indicated time points\" should be stated explicitly in the methods.\n\r\n10) Line 245: The objective function should be stated explicitly.\n\r\n11) To quantify the variance in the normal distributions in the error function, why use bootstrapping replicates while only fitting to the mean data? Why not also incorporate the error from the triplicate experimental observations?\n\r\n12) Particularly in co-cultures, the fits are not good. How can conclusions be drawn? ", "The basic reporting aspects of this paper are sound.  Figures are clear and readable.  Line 76 has a reference to a paper in 2027 that I am assuming is a typo.  \n\r\nI do have some stylistic suggestions.  One common style standard is not to begin sentences with variable names or lower case letters, to aid readability.  In line 35, \"c_1 is. . .\" could be rewritten \"The variable c_1 is. . .\" .  In line 105, \"That's\" may be viewed as too colloquial. The authors  may wish to write \"That is\".  The use of the subequations environment in LaTeX can help organize the mathematics.  The first system of equations could be labelled (1a) to (1d) rather than (1) to (4) and then referenced collectively as system (1).  Similarly with equations (5) to (9). This is outside of my area of expertise as a mathematician. \"Validity\" in the sense applied to experimental papers isn't relevant for a work in modeling and simulation like this.  The model in this case aims to capture the system of interest and to create an abstract object that can be used to enhance understanding and guide future experimental work.  In this sense the work is well on its way to being \"valid\".  \n\r\nThe authors obtain a fair amount of data and use it to fit the parameters for their models.  Here the work seems incomplete.  It is increasingly de rigueur for ODE models in biology, which tend to have a fair number of fitted parameters, or measured parameters with wide error bars, to have a generalized sensitivity analysis done for the parameter space.  Which parameters are the most influential?  How much so?  What do they represent biologically, and what is the biological significance of them being sensitive or insensitive to perturbations? "], "10637": ["\u2022\tThe article lacks the use of clear and ambiguous English. There are several grammatical errors through the text. The current phrasing makes comprehension difficult. \r\n\u2022\tBackground of disease and relevant use of reversine is not clear. Introduction fails to justify why the authors chose to test reversine in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Recent literature in the field is missing (for example, 2019 study in colorectal cancer https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijo.2019.4746) and there is no mention of cell cycle related changes in cholangiocarcinoma. Authors should consider explaining why is cholangiocarcinoma a candidate for reversine related G2/M arrest? There is no background on the relation of PI3K/Akt pathway, HIF1a or GLUT1 and autophagy in the introduction section.  \r\n\u2022\tThe structure of the article is well defined. The original western blot raw data .rar file is not accessible or corrupted. \r\n\u2022\tThe authors defined a hypothesis but have not provided enough evidence to support the conclusions mentioned in the study.\n\r\n---Custom checks \u2013 cell line checks \u2013 KKU-100, KKU-213A, KKU-213B and MMNK-1 are cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. \u2022\tThe research is within the Aims and scope of the journal. \r\n\u2022\tThe study identified the clear need for novel therapies in cholangiocarcinoma and has attempted to fill the gap. However, the authors failed to clearly justify the relevance of blocking G2/M phase of cell cycle and inducing autophagic cell death in cholangiocarcinoma. The authors should consider explaining the concept clearly. \r\n\u2022\tThe investigation is conducted in a random manner. The experimental design is not clear. The method description for cell proliferation and cell cycle assays is not clear. \r\n\u2022\tIn line 59, the cell lines are cultured in a DMEM media. Since the changes are associated with ATP differences in the untreated and treated cells, the author should explain the use of low-glucose or high-glucose DMEM. \r\n\u2022\tIn line 106-110, the range of dosages tested is very few. Since the highest dose tested does not result in 100% death, the dose quoted as IC50 is not true IC50.In Figure 1, 48 hour graph fails to show 100% cell viability at the lowest dose, does this mean that the control or vehicle wells were different for all the time points? The method for drug dose response assay is not clear. In the method section, 5 dosages are tested, whereas in the figure authors are showing only 4 dose points? How was the background correction done? For MMNK-1, the graph shows a clear reduction of % viability. There is no p value or statistical evaluation of the results. \r\n\u2022\tIn line 113-117, what is the ploidy level of these cell lines? How did they infer if the peaks of cell cycle are all from the same ploidy? Did they sort for nuclei? Why is G0-G1 phase not shown in the cell cycle plots? The authors should consider showing cell cycle differences at different time points. Depending on the doubling rate of both of these cell lines, the effect of a cell cycle inhibitor would be better understood in a time dependent manner. Is the G2/M arrest reversible or irreversible? A major predictor of G2-M checkpoint is CDK1 and cyclin A. Authors should consider showing other cell cycle checkpoint regulator proteins to validate the flow-cytometry based G2-M arrest. \r\n\u2022\tIn figure 2C \u2013 for cleaved caspase 3 both the cell lines are showing different bands. Cleaved caspase 3 (CC-3) is depicted by a single and not an array of bands. Authors should comment on the CC-3 western blot image for KKU-213A. No statistics shown for western images. \r\n\u2022\tLC3BII/I blot is not clear. LC3BI band is not visible in the untreated cells, would this be linked to stress in the untreated cell lines? The authors should consider commenting on the autophagy state in the untreated cells and test other autophagy related markers like beclin1A or SQSTM1. The .rar file with all the original blots is not accessible. \r\n\u2022\tAuthors have not tested the cell lines from a chemotherapy point of view so conclusions based on these speculations are too far-fetched.  The authors have identified MMNK-1 as a normal cholangiocyte whereas it is an immortalized cholangiocyte cell line. \u2022\tThe rationale and benefit to literature is not clearly stated. The statistical evaluation of cell proliferation and western blot images is missing. The conclusions made are not limited to supporting results. Several results are tied in with literature based speculations and too far-fetched. Cholangiocarcinoma is a lethal disease and there is an urgent need for novel targeted therapies to improve patient outcome. I commend the authors for their attempt to propose a novel therapy for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. The overall approach used is clear and relevant however it lacks a well-defined thorough experimental analysis. \r\nThe data set is limited with the use of three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and an immortalized cholangiocyte cell line. The cellular proliferation assays are not clearly defined and lack statistical power. Authors have used the proliferation assay data set to justify the use of chemotherapy-resistant cholangiocarcinoma; however, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Although the results are compelling, the cell cycle assays are limited to a single time point and do not display the sub G0 population or ploidy levels. Generally, these cell lines are slow growing and any cell cycle related changes should be analyzed based on their doubling rate. There is clearly an induction of apoptosis but it\u2019s relation to autophagy is not clear. The most important issue is that the untreated cell line also has a LC3BII band but no LC3BI and a lack of statistical analysis. This could be improved by supplementing with other autophagy markers like beclin1A or SQSTM1. \r\nGenerally, the study is interesting and is worth publication but it needs to be majorly revised for clarity and statistical analysis. ", "The manuscript is generally clearly written and structured according to the standard format. The data in the figures and tables are well organized and presented. \r\nHowever, there are a few points that could be improved:\r\n1.The image for GAPDH is missing in Figure 3B, although it is mentioned in the figure legend.\r\n2.Magnification is missing in Figure 3A. In addition, it would be easier for the reader to see the changes if images from higher magnification would be included.\r\n3.The introduction could be expanded to give more information to the reader. The knowledge gap in the field could be further described. The topics studied in the manuscript, such as autophagy/ autophagic cell death, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest could be briefly introduced and the markers, which are being measured in this study, could be very shortly presented. The research questions are well defined in the introduction and the experimental design of the study is generally good.\r\nHowever, some points would need further clarification:\r\n1.Glucose uptake assay: From the Methods section (lines 88-93), it is not very clear if glucose concentration in medium or glucose uptake was measured. There are 2 different kits provided by BioVision: Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay (catalogue number K676) and Glucose Colorimetric Assay (catalogue number K686), with which different parameters can be measured. Including the catalogue number of the kit and a brief description of how the assay was done, would clarify exactly which parameter was studied.\r\n2.Figure legend for Figure 2: It is mentioned that the results shown in this figure were obtained from 2 independent experiments. For a better statistical significance of the results, at least one more independent experiment should be included.\r\n3.Table 1: How the data on IC50 were calculated and obtained should be explained in detail in the Methods section. The conclusions of the study are generally well stated.\r\nThere are a few points, which need to be addressed:\r\n1.Figure 3B and line 127: An increase in the protein levels of LC3-II does not mean there is induction of autophagy. It means there is accumulation of LC3-II and autophagosomes, which could be caused BY increased production of LC3-II (as a consequence of induction of autophagy) OR BY inhibition of fusion autophagosome/autolysosome (which results in inhibition of autophagy). To differentiate between the 2 situations, measurement of autophagic flux could be performed (for example LC3-II Western blot in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, such as bafilomycin A1; Klionsky D et al, Autophagy, 2016).\r\nFor clarification, the comments in the text could be changed or measurement of autophagic flux could be performed.\r\n2.Results, Discussion, Figure 4: Throughout the text, there are statements on causal links, which are not supported by experimental results, such as: \u2018Reversine induced autophagy and apoptosis via inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway\u2019 (line 127). There are no data showing that the reduced PI3K/AKT signalling is the cause for reversine-autophagy induction. For this, analysis of the effect of modulation of PI3K/AKT on reversine-induced autophagy should be performed. This type of statements could be presented as opinions, speculations or hypothesis. In this manuscript, the effects of reversine on different cholangiocarcinoma cell lines are investigated. Cell viability and markers of cell cycle, autophagy, apoptosis and insulin signaling are evaluated. The results indicate that reversine has an antiproliferative effect on these cancer cell lines. Thus, the findings of this study could be potentially interesting in the future for developing novel strategies for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. ", "The English language was clear unambiguous most of the time. Nevertheless, improvement is needed, especially in the introduction section. The introduction and background were very shallow scientifically. The authors talked about the unsatisfactory results of chemotherapy on unrespectable CCA. However, the authors did not detail, which chemotherapy specifically showed unsatisfactory results. The authors said the proposed treatment worked on multiple cancers but did not explain if these pieces of evidence were obtained from the laboratory or human studies (line 44-46). Also, the authors did not talk about the primary resistance mechanism. This is very important to show the gap in the knowledge in treating CCA. Also, this gap in the knowledge will put Reversine in the potential filling of this gap. As of now, the importance of Reversine in treating unrespectable CCA is not clear in comparison with the already available chemotherapies. Figures are relevant. However, some figures are not well labeled or not high quality.\r\nIn figure 2 A, color legends for the cell cycle phase were not clear. In figure 2 C, the quality of the western blot was not high. This was clear in multiple rows, including cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-XL. In figure 3 A, the cell pictures were not clear: the type of scope used, the magnification have not been mentioned. The vacuoles of autophagy were not clear as well. In figure 3 B, the western blot's quality was not good as well, especially on the CLUT3. In addition to all of that, the authors did not talk about the current study's limitations. The study is within the aim and the scope of this journal. However, the research question was not well defined. The authors did not identify the gap in knowledge and how this study research question will fill this gap. The investigation was acceptable with some significant concerns. Western plot experimental quality was weak and inconclusive. Some of the experiments have only repeated two times, which at least should be repeated in triplets. Although the authors used a negative control cell line of the immortal cholangiocytes, positive control was not used in this study using a resistant model to Reversine. Also, the authors used the vehicle but did not compare the standard treatment for CCA. Finally, this is just in vitro study of treatment of effect on cell survival, which is not enough and should be accompanied by in vivo treatment study to see if this treatment is working on these cell lines or patient-derived xenograft models on animals. The methodology could be improved to help in the reproducibility of these findings in other labs. For example, cell cycle analysis in lines 72-76 needs more details here and supplementary material, especially concerning the flow cytometry analysis and gating. Also, the authors decide to use four micromolar as the treatment dose for the subsequent experiments after the viability assays. However, it was not clear why this number. It was not clear why the authors continue the experiments only on two cell lines instead of all the three available. The western plot quality was questionable and not helpful in drawing valid conclusions. The methodology was not novel. The conclusions are very firm for study depends only on in vitro results. Some of the studies' replicates need to be increased to at least three times. The authors found the treatment was effective against the chemo-resistant cell line (KKU-100). However, no clear explanations of why this happened and what is the possible explanation for such a phenomenon. The second sentence in the conclusion section (line 214-215) was written in a convincing tone that needs to be softened, especially that the authors did not take the opportunity to compare this proposed treatment to the standard chemotherapy for CCA, separately or in combination. The study is a good start point to start building a substantial manuscript using more replicate, positive controls and additional experiments on animals. The authors should work more on the gab of the knowledge, its importance and how this new treatment will help in filling this gap. Also, authors should compare this treatment to the current standard chemotherapy for CCA.

These effects can be discussed in regard to specific regions of N protein - whether IRD, RBD, or Dimerization domain where mutation is present. \n\r\nA phylogenetic analysis could be performed with the available sequences using the initial sequence (from Wuhan, China) as root to see how the sequences have evolved over time. Are there any specific residues that are selected over time? What is the effect of these selections on N protein conformation?\n\r\nIntroduction: There are some important articles regarding N protein that can be referred.

It will better if this portion is removed entirely. Also, abrupt bringing of spike glycoprotein in picture might confuse the reader. Instead, authors can directly discuss their findings, the knowledge gained and its future application.\r\nPage 7, Line 215: It will be appropriate to change \u201cprimary\u201d to \u201cprimarily\u201d.\r\nPage 7, Line 233-236: It will be more informative if authors can mention specific residues of N protein to which these drugs interact and what mutations are present in those positions that author have identified.\n\r\nFigures and Table Legends\r\nPage 8: Line 250-253: The text looks redundant and needs rephrasing, as the same information is already described in page 3, line 81-86 and page 4, line 125-129. \r\nSuggestion: The N protein comprising of 419 residues is shown. The RNA binding domain, dimerization domain, intrinsically disordered regions including IRD1, IRD2, and IRD3 are labelled.\n\r\nFigure 2: It will more appealing to the readers if the panel labeling is done inside, instead of outside. It is suggested to move mutant name inside the panels. Also, author can label N- and C-terminus in figure panels. Also, keep all structures in the same orientation - Panel A seems to be in different orientation as compared to others.\n\r\nFigure 3: Similarly, to Figure 2, it is suggested to move mutant name inside the panels. Also, measure atomic distances and label in corresponding panels. Legend should clearly mention what kind of interaction different dots indicate. For instance, the polar interactions are depicted in red dotted line, hydrophobic interaction in green. Only show important interactions and corresponding distances. It can be done by downloading PyMOL sessions instead of direct images from DynaMut web server. The interatomic distances can be measured in PyMOL.\n\r\nPage 8, Line 270-273: Table 1: The following sentences seem redundant as author has already discussed it earlier in the text, \u201cThese mutations are present in the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 reported from USA. The first reported sequence of N protein from Wuhan, China was used as wild type sequence for this analysis. The table shows only those residues that have variation, rest of the sequences are identical among all samples.\u201d. Suggestion is to remove it or rephrase.\n\r\nThe same text is repeated from Table 1 legend. Removal of these sentences is recommended in the following:\r\nPage 9, Line 275-279: Table 2\r\nPage 9, Line 282-285: Table 3\r\nPage 9, Line 288-291: Table 4\r\nPage 9, Line 294-297: Table 5\n\r\nAnother minor suggestion is to use consistent scheme for tables, either use smaller or capital letter in the header. In some places author has mentioned wild type residue while in other it is Wild type residue. Also, S.No in table 4 is S.No. in other tables. ", "In this work, Azad Gajendra K performed sequence analysis of 4163 sequences of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 from United States of America to identify the variations present in it. This study identified 107 mutations those are distributed all over the N protein. The analysis also finds mutations in RNA binding domain (RBD) and dimerization domain of N protein. The effects of these mutations were predicted using DynaMut programe and concluded that some mutations could possibly hamper N protein functions. Overall, this is reasonable analysis that would advance our understanding of variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, some changes could further improve the quality of the manuscript.\n\r\n1)\tWhat is probability of mutations- representing it in logo plot would be helpful.\r\n2)\tShow mutations (structural representation) in carton and surface diagram of crystal structure and highlighting mutated residues in one color for overall distribution of mutations in the protein.\r\nThe structure representation is not properly presented.

"], "10423": ["The review collects fungal proteomics work produced during the decade 2008-2018 with a special focus on proteome rearrangements as triggered by temperature stress. The manuscript is written in a clear and unambiguous English and is of interest, however there are some recommendations below to strengthen and improve its quality.\n\r\nA number of reviews on fungal proteomics are available documenting stress response, host-pathogenic interactions, biotechnological applications or describing the advancement of proteomics techniques applied to the investigation of the fungal proteome. As compared to those, this manuscript offers an insight into the very specific topic of temperature stress, which had not been the main subject of a review on fungal proteomics yet. The introduction adequately explains the subject of the review, describing the crucial role of fungi in soil microbial communities as well as the importance of protein biomarkers of fungal stress for the monitoring of environmental changes. The article content is within the aims and scope of the journal. The review collects the results of not more than 10 studies produced between 2008 and 2018, which reflects the limited number of proteomics studies specifically including temperature stress hitherto available. Two considerations on this regard: 1_ I understand the aim to focus on a specific time span, however I fear that excluding the last two years of research will have an impact on the completeness of the review, along with making it not thoroughly up-to-date. Two works, among others, that focus on heat stress, would be worth a mention i.e. Zou et al., 2018 DOI=10.3389/fmicb.2018.02368  and of Deng et al., 2020 https://doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.1012. 2_One of the aims of the manuscript is to provide an overview of the implications of temperature stress for fungal responses within the ecosystem to current climate change challenges. However, the authors do not expand on this aspect other than in the introduction, whose content sets expectations about a manuscript primarily dealing with soil fungi and their potential as biomarkers of global warming.

This sentence is not entirely clear. According to Tesei et al. (2015) a much slower growth rate is a consequence of the down-regulation of the metabolism that black fungi undergo upon low temperature stress. \n\r\nLines 280-281: The authors state that \u201cMrakia psychrophila has been shown to respond to low temperature stress in a very similar fashion to other cold-adapted fungi.\u201d However, chaperones and energy metabolism pathways are found to be upregulated in the yeast upon exposure to low temperature, which is in contrast with what observed in E. dermatitidis, the study cited just before in the text. What do the authors mean by cold-adapted fungi? Psychrophilic fungi?

In the case of E. dermatitidis, both 37 and 45\u00b0C are indicated as T optimum, however the correct temperature optimum is solely 37 \u00b0C. In Tesei et al. (2015), following growth at 37\u00b0C, E. dermatitidis was exposed to 1 or 45\u00b0C for 1 hour (short-term exposure) or 1 week (long-term exposure) in order to monitor the yeast response to both low- and high-temperature stress. Protein profiles from the different temperatures of exposure were compared in order to assess protein modulation. \r\nPlease consider editing the table as well as the text, accordingly. The portion of Table 2 describing proteins and pathways affected by the exposure of E. dermatitidis (with optimum at 45\u00b0C) to 1\u00b0C shall be edited to point out that 45\u00b0C is not the fungus temperature optimum, but one of the experimental conditions.\r\nPlease also cross-check the part of Table 2 displaying up and down regulated proteins at 1\u00b0C as compared with the optimal temperature of 37\u00b0C, as e.g. acetate metabolism is listed among up-regulated pathways but instead it exhibits lower levels at 1\u00b0C.

Good overview of relevance and importance of mycological studies and fungal organisms within communities. Language is passive at times (e.g., can be due to, been made based on the), such statements should be minimized to strengthen the impact of the manuscript. Some proof-reading of acronyms and shortening of scientific names before proper names are introduced need to be addressed.

Notes in the General Comments section address concern over arguments and focus established in the abstract and introduction that are not clear throughout the manuscript.\n\r\nThe concluding remarks section would be strengthened by highlighting specific information gained by conducting the current Review The title refers to temperature stress in general, but the abstract emphasizes agricultural applications and the main body of the text focuses on agricultural and medical fungal species. Providing some clarity on the emphasis in the abstract would help the reader follow the direction of the manuscript. Why emphasizing agricultural relevance? It\u2019s a good topic and important but a little more justification would help the reader.\r\nSeveral of the highlighted studies seem to use qualitative analyses to determine in proteins are increased or decreased in abundance by reporting presence/absence. It would be valuable for the authors to discuss limitations of such studies where absence may be technical variation/error if quantification values are not available, or increased abundance could be attributed to differences in staining between two gels if no normalization is provided. Such statements could be provided in the last paragraph of the \u2018high temperature stress\u2019 section as this is paragraph reads as a discussion of the studies reported to date.\n\r\nSpecific comments:\r\nAbstract: \r\n-\tWhat is the difference between a traditional vs. systematic review process?\r\n-\tHow can PTM in stress pathways identify potential biomarkers?

Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes, and the incidence has increased faster than any other cancer over the past half century. Most primary cutaneous melanoma can be cured by local excision, but metastatic cutaneous melanoma has a poor prognosis. Therefore, the research on the mechanism of cutaneous melanoma metastasis will be beneficial to diagnose the metastatic melanoma early, improve the treatment, and prolong the survival of patients. In this study, Dai Hangying and colleagues identified the key genes and molecular pathways involved in the occurrence and metastasis of cutaneous melanoma. The study provides the conclusion, which showed that some DEGs were found from normal skin, primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma samples. These hub genes may play an important role in the generation, invasion, recurrence or death of CM, providing new ideas and targets for the diagnosis and treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma. There are some problems in this study, which require the author to revise the research design, and there are some major concerns that need to be addressed.\n\r\nMajor concerns:\r\n1. \u201cValidity of the findings\u201d The title of this manuscript is that \u201cComprehensive analysis and identification of key genes and signaling pathways in cutaneous melanoma metastasis\u201d. However, from the analysis results and conclusions of the manuscript, the author did not identify convincing analysis, but only found a bunch of differentially expressed genes, analyzed the potential functions and pathways, and found a dozen genes related to prognosis. The correlation analysis used in this study can only indicate the possibility of an important role and should not be exaggerated. The author had to make a careful revision of the language.\r\n2. \u201cValidity of the findings\u201d The authors used multiple databases to analyze differentially expressed genes between primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma and identified these genes as the key genes associated with melanoma metastasis. However, the process of metastasis is complex, and the genes specifically expressed in the metastasis foci may be a passive process for the cancer cells to adapt to the microenvironment of the metastasis foci, rather than \"drivers\". Therefore, there is a big deviation between the subject design idea and the research objective in this paper, and the results and conclusions cannot support each other. I would suggest that the authors reformulate the purpose of the study and redesign the analysis process according to the purpose. The key is not to make the purpose too large, but to focus on a specific clinical problem or tumor biology problem.\r\n3. \u201cResults \u2013 Validation of hub genes and survival curve analysis\u201d Line 201-208. When using TCGA database for verification, the author firstly verified the expression differences of selected genes in primary foci (n = 104) and metastatic foci (n = 368), and then analyzed the relationship between related genes and survival prognosis of patients, proving the importance of related genes. However, as can be seen from the survival curve in Figure 8, the author did not simply analyze the relationship between the expression of relevant genes in the primary site and the survival prognosis of patients, but included all the data of the primary site and the metastatic site into the analysis (n = 250+), which was obviously a logical problem. The prognosis of patients with metastatic foci is certainly worse than that of patients with primary foci alone. The analyzed genes have been found to be abnormally expressed in metastatic foci. If the samples of all patients are integrated and analyzed, the correlation between these genes and prognosis is inevitable and has no real diagnostic value. Therefore, the authors analyzed the survival or prognosis of related genes in patients with primary and metastatic foci respectively. ", "The authors provide a detailed bioinformatics analysis of the mechanisms involved in cutaneous melanoma progression. I believe that some aspects of their analyses are over-represented, while some other ones are not. I would focus mainly on the comparison between PM and MM.\r\nI beleive that the English language should be improved. Please check that the correct tense for all verbs is used . My major concern regarding the experimental design is whether the comparison between melanoma (primary or not) and normal skin, in order to identify Differentially Expressed Genes, is valid. I mean that the comparison between cancer and normal melanocytes could be much more meaningful.Could the authors check also this comparison at least at the datasets that contain samples of normal melanocytes or nevi?\r\nI would suggest that the authors include a table describing the datasets that they have analysed, presenting details concerning the number of normal skin, primary or metastatic samples per analysis. The number of differentiated genes could also be indicated. I believe that the presented bioinformatics analyses are robust and statistically sound.  \r\nIn my opinion there are many tables concerning the GO and Kegg-based analyses. I would suggest to keep those concerning the PM versus MM DEGs and present the others as supplementary files. \r\nRegarding figure 7 I couldn\u2019t understand why the y axis is indicated in Transcripts per million and why the category normal is presented with n=1.

The authors should add more literature references about some related works.\r\n- Some abbreviations need to be defined at the first use. - Research design is a big concern. Why did the authors perform the analysis among three groups? If the problem aims to address cutaneous melanoma metastasis, why did the authors not compare between metastasis and non-metastasis only? Or if the authors compared three groups, why did the authors separate into three binary problems? Is it possible if the authors perform the analysis on all three groups together?\r\n- Methods have not been explained well and it is not easy to replicate.

"], "10397": ["The manuscript broadly meets all the criteria and expected standards. However, I recommend authors to provided a English-translated version of the written consent form (currently in Chinese), as this has been presented as a Supplemental evidence. I have a few comments on the results presented and conclusions drawn by the authors.\n\r\n1. There is an instance of minor image duplication in Figure 1E. In the upper panel comprising of Normal (Upper) Cytoplasmic (Left) and Nuclear YAP1 (middle), authors use slightly shifted field-of-views of the same image to extract the inset crop. If possible, provide an image of another field for the Nuclear YAP1 data. If you intend to use the same image, please provide the exact same field of view for both data set and mention the same in the figure legend.\n\r\n2. Authors report overall similar trends in their results when scoring for either \u2018High cytoplasmic YAP1\u2019 or \u2018Low YAP1 NCR\u2019. While these two are intuitively linked, the ratio could be biased by differences in Nuclear Levels of YAP1. Authors have provided independent quantification of the same in Fig 1 B-D. I feel this result could be bolstered by adding a correlation scatter plot of Cytoplasmic v/s Nuclear YAP1 H-score, to rule there are any non-trivial relations between them, which might bias their results. The differential effects of chemotherapy on high cytosolic YAP1 cells constitute the key finding of this manuscript. Please highlight this in the abstract more clearly. ", "1.\tClear legend should be provided for Figure 1E. It is not clear what the colors represents, and it is not clear what are the differences between the images presented and what is the message each image is delivering to the readers. \r\n2.\tComparing the H-scores in Figure 1E with that in Figure 1B-D, it seems that images presented in Figure 1E are examples of extreme H-scores. Those images are not representative staining. \r\n3.\tIn Line 62 of the Introduction, the authors mentioned the need of new biomarkers for CRC prognosis. I think the authors should introduce if there are other biomarkers for CRC prognosis and discuss about how YAP1 is different from or better than existing biomarkers. \r\n4.\tIn Lines 66-74. The authors first introduced the paradoxical reports of YAP1 either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene, then proposed the need of establishing a clear relationship between YAP1 expression and its clinical relevance. I think the authors should discuss why they think the relationship they have established is clearer than those in previous reports instead of simply one more example being added to the existing paradoxical reports. \r\n5.\tRaw data. A lot of information, including TNM stage, differentiation grade, manual grading of H-score before averaging, etc., are not provided in the raw data used for Figures 2-3 and Tables 1-2. Raw data for Figure 1B-E are not provided.\r\n6.\tThe font size in Figure 2 is too small. 1.\tIn Lines 88-95 bioinformatics analysis, the authors used publicly available gene datasets. The authors should describe how and why they select those specific datasets for their analysis. Are those all the related datasets available from the database, or are they randomly selected from the database? In Line 90, the authors should provide more details on how the data are normalized. 1.\tIn Lines 193-194, the authors concluded that high cytoplasmic YAP1 expression may contribute to CRC aggressiveness. This conclusion is not justified as the data only suggest for a correlation but not for a causation. It is equally likely that YAP1 expression is modified as CRC progresses to a more advanced stage, i.e. CRC progression contributes to cytoplasmic YAP1 expression.\r\n2.\tThe conclusion (Lines 215-216, Lines 228-229, and Lines 264-265) generated from Figure 3 is not justified. Firstly, the sample size for the groups without chemotherapy is too small, it is premature to draw any conclusions based on the current data (i.e. Fig. 3C-D, Fig. S3C-D). Secondly and most importantly, to evaluate whether chemotherapy has an effect on cytoplasmic YAP1-low group or cytoplasmic YAP1-high group, and whether the effect of chemotherapy is different due to the expression level of cytoplasmic YAP1 level, the authors should compare the group with chemotherapy (either high cytoplasmic YAP1 or low cytoplasmic YAP1) to the corresponding group without chemotherapy first, and then check, for example, if chemotherapy is effective for the cytoplasmic YAP1-low patients but not effective for the cytoplasmic YAP1-high patients. The current comparison in Figure 3 only answers the question whether chemotherapy influences the prognostic role of cytoplasmic YAP1 level, but not the question whether cytoplasmic YAP1 level influences the chemotherapy effect. In this manuscript, Dong and colleagues investigated the relationship between YAP1 expression and colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. They found a correlation between CRC progression with cytoplasmic but not nuclear YAP1 expression, with high cytoplasmic YAP1 corresponding to poor prognosis. This is an interesting finding as YAP is a transcriptional co-activator which regulates gene expression when transported to the nucleus. However, some of the conclusions are not justified. Please see specific comments for details. ", "The authors have investigated the subcellular loacalization of YAP-1 protein in CRC samples and examined its potential correlation to CRC prognosis and Disease specific/free survival. They calculated YAP-1 staining intensity h scores and studies TMA. \n\r\nThe language is simple, clear and non ambiguous. Authors have provided proper references. A little descriptive background about why YAP-1 plays a role in CRC, its dual role in CRC as an oncogene and a tumor suppressor,  and its association to hippo pathway might be insightful. The overall observational analysis suggesting that higher nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP-1 expression is associated with aggravated CRC. \r\n1. The authors suggest that YAP1 mRNA expression was elevated in 3 GEO and 1 TCGA dataset upon analysis following which they mention that other 5 GEO datasets also exhibit similar results. Is there a significance to segregating the first 3 and other 5 GEO datasets while analysis and result interpretation?\r\n2. Suppression of  YAP-1 phosphorylation leads to its higher nuclear accumulation and has been previously reported to be correlated to CRC prognosis. However, the authors have shown that CRC samples had both high nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP-1 expression. What is the significance of higher cytoplasmic YAP-1? YAP-1 regulates and drives multiple pathways and It would add to the study if authors look into the pathways that drive its high cytoplasmic expression in CRC.\r\n3. Authors observe that subjects that underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and had high cytoplasmic YAP-1 had a shorter DFS and DSS. Authors can extrapolate this observation to in vitro studies to understand the actual mechanism of how cytoplasmic YAP-1 expression can determine the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy. If authors are able to verify this observation through mechanistic evaluation, it is the most important and interesting finding of this study.\r\n4. Did authors see any age dependent or gender dependent cytoplasmic/ nuclear YAP-1 variability? \r\n5. In the discussion section, authors have reported previous literature on how the upregulation of EGFR by YAP1 confers chemoresistance to esophageal cancer cells . It will be intersting to see if their observation on effect of high cytoplasmic YAP-1 on adjuvant chemotherapy is also due to EGF-R upregulation or other factors. \r\n6. If I understand correctly, the cytoplasmic YAP-1 expression was high in all malignant CRC irrespective of stage. What is the prognostic value of YAP-1 in differentiating the stage based on its expression. The study is interesting in many facets owing to its clinical significance however it is mostly observational and bioinformatic. To assess and confirm these observations,  elucidating the underlying cause of YAP-1 cytoplasmic up-regulation in CRC will be highly useful.  \r\nThe english needs minor revision and language editing. Overall the paper is easy to understand and direct. Fine tuning the discussion can help interpret the finding of the study more significantly. Authors can add the most recent work on correlation between YAP-1 and CRC.

The experimental model involves treatment of HepG2 cells with palmitate + ethanol + BSA  or with BSA alone.   There does not seem to be challenge with insulin at any stage.  \r\nIt has been reported previously that ethanol inhibits AMPK (You M, matsumoto M. et al Gastroenterology 2002; 127:1798-1808) but palmitate activates AMPK (Kawaguchi T. et al., JBC 2002, 277; 3829-3836).  The authors therefore need to consider whether the decrease in AMPK by palmitate/ethanol (Fig. 4B) is due to the ethanol rather than the palmitate and whether the activation of AMPK by SG1-4 is independent of reversal of insulin resistance but is due to direct activation of AMPK.  The model proposes that the activation of AMPK by SGs is upstream of IRS and Akt signalling.  This can be tested using an allosteric AMPK activator such as A-769662.

I supposed that Figure 3C should be \"TG\" content and Figure 3D should be \"TC\" content. However, two figures had the same labels. In general, the experimental design could be improved in following aspect.\r\n1. When insulin resistance is claimed, there should be evidence showing that insulin signaling is impaired by palmitate treatment. Therefore, in addition to basal condition, insulin stimulated condition should be also considered. This part of the data was not shown in this manuscript.\r\n2. Basal glucose uptake was reduced by PA treatment. Is this due to \"insulin resistance\" in the absence of insulin stimulation? Besides, the rationale to put glucose uptake data with TG and TC content is not clear. Glucose uptake should be related to glycogen deposition and separated from PA-induced lipid accumulation issue.\r\n3. How do SGs sensitize PA induced insulin resistance via AMPK activation remained to be clarified. Inhibitor study should be employed. \r\n4. Due to the observation that SGs compounds can activate AMPK and reduce TG and TC content in PA treated cells, AMPK down stream substrate should be also analyzed.  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is one of the key substrate for AMPK to regulate beta-oxidation. Therefore, effects of SGs on ACC phosphorylation should be also measured. Such effect should be blocked by AMPK inhibitors to demonstrate that SGs action is really mediated by AMPK activation.\r\n5. SREBP1 downstream genes related to lipid metabolism should be also measured in the current study to claim that SGs inhibits lipid deposition via SREBP1 . In general, findings are too preliminary and experiments need to be expended.  Insulin stimulation condition should be included in \"Insulin resistance\" study. Inhibitor for AMPK should be used to strengthen the validity of finding in the investigation.

Three different varieties of cinnamon submitted to distint extraction methods were prepared and tested for their enzyme inhibitory activity. The results showed that extracts prepared using pressured water and as a decoctions were more potent in inhibiting \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase activity, and had the potential to extract higher content of proanthocyanidin than other methods of extraction. The hypothesis is quite attractive, experimental design is sound and methods seem adequate, in particular the exhaustive chemical characterization of the extract; results are clearly presented and discussed and look promissing for a future utilization in humans.

In addition, they employed ZFPM2-AS1-siRNA and western blot to show ZFPM2-AS1 might regulate via JAK-STAT and AKT pathway and PD-L1. The data is enough to support the ZFPM2-AS1 is involved in NSCLC. The ZFPM2-AS1 might serve as a potential target of lung cancer treatment/immunotherapy in the future. However, the whole manuscript was poorly written, and results/figures are not well-organized, and it still needs more evidence to prove ZFPM2-AS1 involved in the JAK-STAT and AKT pathway. The manuscript requires substantial revision before acceptance. Here I have some suggestions and comments that may be helpful to improve the manuscript.\n\r\nMajor point:\r\nA.\tYour most important issue is scientific paper writing.\r\nyour manuscript needs careful editing by English native speaker OR professional language editing service. Please pay attention to sentence structure, verb tense, and clause construction. Additionally, the authors should write the paper in logistic order, especially the result section (Figure 7).\n\r\nB.\tThe next most important item is Figure 6. \r\nIt still needs more convincing evidence to support ZFPM2-AS1 involved in JAK-STAT and AKT pathway. JAK-STAT and AKT pathway is the new and most important finding of ZFPM2-AS function in your study.\n\r\nC.\tAll the figures need to be carefully edited.\n\r\nAll details are listed below:\r\n1.\tThe author should use \u201ctargeting\u201d carefully in the title. According to the results you presented, you did not figure out the real target (gene/miRNAs) of LncRNA ZFPM2-AS1. In addition, it is generally believed that JAK-STAT and AKT are two distinct signaling pathways, and the AKT pathway is not the direct upstream of STAT, although these signaling pathways can be integrated in some cases. \r\n2.\tLine 29. Please make sure if you use \u201cRT-PCR\u201d rather than \u201cqRT-PCR\u201d to examine the transcription level of ZFPM2-AS1.\r\n3.\tLine 41, the author mentioned the \u201cPD-1\u201d in abstract, but there is no description concerning PD-1 in the result section. \r\n4.\tLine 64\u201d warranted\u201d in here is very confused.\r\n5.\tThere are many sentences with sentence structure problems, i.e. Line 51-53, line 62-64\u2026 please addressed these issues in the whole manuscript.\r\n6.\tThe introduction was not well-written, your need to make a comprehensive review on the LncRNA of your interest (ZFPM2-AS1)[there are more than 10 papers in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=ZFPM2-AS1)], and don\u2019t pay too much attention to other unrelated lncRNAs in JAK-STAT and AKT pathway(line 71-85). And it needs some background information about IFN-\u03b3 to make your audience clear about your study.\r\n7.\tLine 97 \u201cdifferent \u201d\r\n8.\tLine 110 &131, \u201dCO2\u201d (\u201c2\u201d here should be subscript)\r\n9.\tLine 125, 4x103; (\u201c3\u201d here should be superscript), please carefully check the same issues in otherwhere, line 135, line 143\u2026etc.\r\n10.\tLine 165, please indicated the manufacture information of \u201cIP lysis\u201d, check if \u201cIP lysis\u201d is the correct name of this reagent.\r\n11.\tline 198, \u201cone lung normal epithelial cell line, four NSCLC cell lines, and one tool cell line \u201d, avoid this kind of usage in a scientific paper, please state the specific name of cell lines.\r\n12.\tLine 202, \u201cincluding H1299 and H292\u201d, should be \u201cincluding H1299 cells and H292 cells\u201d, please carefully proofread the similar issues in otherwhere, line 218, line 219, line 229, line 232, line233\u2026...\r\n13.\tLine 206, please indicate the abbreviation\u201d TNM\u201d information.\r\n14.\tLine 216, please add a short description of why you use IFN-\u03b3 for your study, and there is no description in introduction and otherwhere (result and discussion), which will make the readers very confused. \r\n15.\tAnother confusing point: The whole paper focused on the ZFPM2-AS1 rather than ZFPM2 (although ZFPM2 is a potential target of ZFPM2-AS1 lncRNA). The authors present lots of data to prove the role of ZFPM2-AS1 in NSCLC, but at the end of the results (Result-3.8), the authors tried to explain the role of ZFPM2 in tumor immune infiltration. Please explain it OR re-organize the results to make readers clear about the object of your research.\r\n16.\tLine 253 \u201cMeanwhile, the expression of JAK2, p-STAT3 and p-AKT was decreased, compared with the control group. However, there was no significant differential expression in STAT3 and AKT\u201d. Typically, phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2), rather than JAK2, represents \u201cactive status\u201d in the signaling study, in my opinion, you should check the pJAK2 (the ratio of pJAK2/total JAK2).\r\n17.\tResult 3.7, The most important finding in this article is ZFPM2-AS1 involved with JAK-STAT and AKT pathway. I guess the authors try to use the IFN-\u03b3 to activate the JAK-STAT pathway (not stated in the manuscript), however, it still cannot exclude that ZFPM2-AS1 regulate NSCLC by other pathways(like p53 pathways), in my opinion, you should use JAK inhibitors to block the JAK-STAT pathway, and then check if the inhibitors can abolish (at least attenuate) the effect of ZFPM2-AS1 on proliferation/migration/invasion of lung cancer cells. You may present at least one piece of data in this section.\r\n18.\tLine 287-299. Please don\u2019t overstate the JAK-STAT pathway that is well-known signaling in cancer, this paper focused on ZFPM2-AS1, you may discuss how ZFPM2-AS1 regulates JAK-STAT pathway and whether other pathways (for example, p53 pathway that you mentioned in the introduction) involved in ZFPM2-AS1 regulatory network.\r\n19.\tConclusion.

For example, in lines #59, #67, #81\u2013 words like mounting, frustrate and sponging are out of context and provide ambiguous meaning. I would recommend that the authors restructure these sentences to make it clear. \n\r\nb.\tIt is not clearly stated that the authors consider both lung adenocarcinomas and lung squamous cell carcinomas for their work presented here. It is to be assumed based on their results. However, I would recommend adding a clear statement to their methods section to remove any ambiguity. a.\tThe authors choose to focus specifically on signaling driven by phosphorylation of Akt on Ser47 vs Thr308. However studies have shown activation at these sites have different phenotypic effects and consequences in cancer cells such as https://doi.org/10.1038/bjc.2011.132 . The authors should address this by looking at Akt phosphorylation at this site via western blotting. (If possible).\n\r\nb.\tThe data shown in figures 3C and 3D do not seem very convincing. There is significant inconsistency in the data presented with some experiments performed in only H460 and some only in A549. Specifically, in figure 3C and 3D, the difference in proliferation between the control and sample (either siZFPM-AS1 or overexpression of AFPKM-AS1) seems too small to be significant. The raw data provided show much variation in their values. I would recommend that the authors verify their statistical tests keeping the variation between replicated in mind. The authors should also address why only one cell line was chosen for certain experiments vs others or provide data for both to make their study more robust. \n\r\nc.\tThere is a lack of explanation on the relevance of the JAK-STAT pathway and the use of IFN-gamma induction of this pathway in NSCLC specifically. The authors do try to expand on this in the discussion but some further expansion on  this may be helpful. The authors can refer to reviews like 10.1080/21623996.2014.999503 and https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers6020708 to further supplement the introduction and discussion.\n\r\nd.\tIn their TCGA data analysis, the authors do not mention what studies were included in their 535 lung cancer cohort.

The article ZFPM2-AS1 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion in human non-small cell lung cancer cells by targeting JAK/AKT/STAT pathway by Wang et al is a generally well-put together article aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism of lncRNA ZFPKM-AS1 on the tumorigenic characteristics of NSCLC. I commend the authors on testing the effects of both loss and overexpression of ZFPKM-AS1 on multiple characteristics of tumor cells. I was specifically impressed by their assessment of 50 clinical samples in this context. I further appreciate the efforts of the authors in sharing the raw data for almost figure represented in the paper to aid transparency and provide confidence in their results. However, there are some concerns with the paper in its current version as detailed above. ", "1. The most important issue is the English language used throughout the manuscript. I suggest the authors carefully proof-read and further improve the quality. Many sentences were grammatically incorrect. Some examples include line 60(\u2026lncRNAs might role\u2026), line 61 (\u2026differential expression lncRNAs\u2026), line 237(\u2026in the nuclear...), etc. Some other phrases, albeit grammatically correct, were scientifically confusing. Examples include line 63 (...biological behavior of NSCLC cells...), line 86(...proliferation, migration, and invasion capacity of ZFPM2-AS1 in NSCLC cells), line 215(...the decreased efficiency...), line 261 (...distinctly inhibited...), etc.\n\r\n2. Please define and spell out acronyms where they appeared for the first time. Some examples include ZFPM2-AS1, MIF, NC, etc.\n\r\n3. I think it would be helpful to briefly summarize/conclude at the end of each Results subsection. The last sentence of section 3.4 was a good example.\n\r\n4. Some figure labels are barely visible.\n\r\n5. Line 283 needs reference 1. It would be helpful to explain the rationales of different analyses done in Figures 1B and 1C, either in the legends or text.\n\r\n2. Could the authors explain why they used IFN-\u03b3 in the proliferation experiments. Because this was used extensively throughout the manuscript, it might be worth mentioning in the introduction. Along the same line, could the authors comment on why some differences were only significant in the presence of IFN-\u03b3, e.g. Figure 3C? I appreciate that this manuscript had extensive amount of results, most of which are well controlled. My biggest concern, however, is that the differential expression of the lncRNA ZFPM2-AS1 in various NSCLC samples and cell lines. In fact, as the authors reported, ZFPM2-AS1 was significantly downregulated in two out of four cell lines experimented. This should not be overlooked and should be commented on, given that the authors proposed this to be a promising prognostic marker and even a therapeutic target.\n\r\nPlease include quantification of the western blotting results in Figures 6A and 6B, normalized to internal controls. "], "10082": ["The goal of this work was to use the trace element composition of bat fur to infer geographic origins.  The paper is well written, logically organized, and should attract interest.  That said, I\u2019m concerned about a number of issues.  First, the scale of the geochemical data.  As the authors point out, the original surveys were very coarse (one site per 1600 km2) and this seems to present a major mismatch with respect to the objectives, especially when precision is interpreted at the 10\u2019s of km scale.  Further, the geochemical data surface is very different than the hydrogen isotope isoscape, which has much better data density and interpolation heavily based on known relationships (i.e. orography, elevation, etc.).  Such constraints on geochemical data are likely lacking.  Second, the training data (fur) seems very limited in both density and space; the actual sample size is never mentioned.  Additionally, the relationship between fur and soil is very weak, with the highest R2 explaining about 15% and only three elements yielding significant R2 values (most with very low R2 values).  Lastly, I\u2019m concerned that the input functions for elements into fur were all treated similarly and this is likely problematic.  In other words, some elements bioaccumulate to a greater extent than others (for example, Ni accumulates more than Hg).  And to bring this back to hydrogen isotopes, the input function is used in assignment models.  I do note, however, that the authors disclose all of these problems early on in the results section and then adopt a multivariate solution to assess assignment accuracy and precision.  Despite the design issues, I do think this is worthy of publication because it highlights the knowledge gaps surrounding the use of elemental data for assignment purposes.  My recommendations are to discuss i)  the coarse spatial resolution of the geochemical data and how that might impact the efficacy of using such data for assignment purposes (this was not discussed, yet the early results demonstrate the problem in my opinion) and ii) better address the elemental input function issue (Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mg \u2013 three of the five are essential). ", "This paper sought to use trace element analysis results from fur samples taken from bats to assign origins (e.g. location of fur growth) to individual bats. The eventual goal is to use this technique on unknown-origin migrants, but this paper focused on developing and ground-truthing the method using known-origin samples. Results were promising, with the trace element profiles of the fur samples corresponding with those of previously taken soil samples at the location of fur growth. Assuming a probability of origin threshold of 0.5, bats could be assigned to their location of origin about 80% of the time and the total area from which bats may have originated was decreased to about half of the species total range. \n\r\nThe paper was fairly well written with a clear list of goals. There were some unclear parts and a quite a few small typos, which I itemize in the general comments section below. The introduction provided an appropriate and thorough background on the subject matter. The figures and tables were well done, although I do not understand Figure 4. It is not clear to me what it is showing and so I cannot comment on whether it is necessary; the caption needs to be clearer.  \n\r\nIn my opinion, the discussion is the weakest part of this otherwise very strong paper. I thought that several parts of it could be removed. For example, the whole paragraph on assumptions about the timing of fur growth really repeated what was in the introduction and didn\u2019t need to be there. Also, the paragraph talking about previous studies on genetics basically concludes that so far, we can\u2019t use genetics at all to assign origins to members of the study species. This could have been summarized in one sentence. I think the section talking about the impact of diet on the trace element composition of tissues and the section talking about the future utility of combining multiple origin assignment techniques are the most important parts of the discussion. There could be more on diet \u2013 currently only one paper is cited that talks about the diet of the study species and one other species and this paper is quite old. Much more work has been done on dietary preferences of these species since then. Could the authors elaborate on the findings of this more recent work and talk about specifically which trace element measurements might be impacted by a broader diet? What about in other species? The research questions are well defined and explicitly stated. The introduction makes clear how the study is contributing to filling a significant knowledge gap (adding to the scant literature about trace elements in bat fur, using these data for origin assignment). To my eye, the statistical approach was extremely rigorous and clearly explained. The paper worked through four separate statistical processes and these seemed logical and according to best practices based on my own experience, which has mainly been working with origin assignment models based on stable hydrogen isotope results. \n\r\nMy one criticism is that I found the methods/results explaining the linkage between fur and soil trace element profiles to be very confusing. The methods state that linear models were used to make this link and in the results, I see that there were no strong relationships between individual trace elements in fur and soil. The results then go on to describe the results of multivariate analyses and I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the details (line 277). I understand that PC1 scores were used to summarize the trace element profiles of the fur samples. Were sPCA analyses also done on the trace element profiles of the soil samples? Were the linear models looking at the relationship between PC1 of fur and PC1 of soil? Or am I misunderstanding? I would appreciate this being explained more clearly. \n\r\nWith respect to ethical considerations, the paper should state that the Smithsonian Museum approved the present use of their samples for trace element analysis (as the paper indicates that fur samples were taken for a previous project in 2014 on stable hydrogen isotopes and museums often approve destructive sampling of specimens for specific projects and require additional explicit permissions if those samples are to be used for other projects). All data are provided, but I have a suggestion: I really like figure 3 in the manuscript and recommend it be retained as it is, however in the spirit of sharing all data (as requested by PeerJ), the authors might consider providing maps like the ones in figure 3 for all individual bats in the study (in a supplemental file). The conclusions are appropriate. Based on my own experience, analyses appear well done, but I do not have experience in trace element analysis and cannot critique the description of the laboratory techniques. Overall \u2013 Personally, I do not like the term \u201ctree-roosting bats\u201d to refer to the trio of bats that are the focus of the introduction (eastern red bats, hoary bats, silver-haired bats). There are many other bat species that roost in trees and in many instances where the focal species have been found roosting out of trees. I realize that \u201ctree roosting\u201d is a fairly common term in the context that the authors are using it, but I\u2019ve seen pushback on this terminology in other places and I tend to agree. I would recommend simply referring to \u201cmigratory bats in North America\u201d. I\u2019ve also seen \u201clatitudinal migrants\u201d used (to differentiate from hibernating species who may migrate in all directions), but more recent work looking at the movements of these three species even suggests that \u201clatitudinal\u201d is an oversimplification.\r\nLine 19 \u2013 I think \u201csource\u201d should be plural\r\nLine 39 \u2013 You might consider citing Rodhouse et al. (2019) here as well, as they come to similar conclusion.\r\nLine 45 \u2013 I would clean up the sentence that states that \u201cmost bats that die are migratory\u201d. In fact, I don\u2019t think there is a lot of direct evidence that bats that die a wind energy facilities are migratory (cite the few papers that do demonstrate this). The main evidence for the bulk of the mortality being migrants is the timing of the mortality: during fall the migratory period. Be precise in wording: e.g. \u201cMost bat mortality occurs during the fall migratory period and many of these individuals are likely engaging in migration.\u201d\r\nLine 52: In talking about migratory animals, it is very important to use clear and replicated terminology throughout. For example, here, the use of \u201clocal populations\u201d is not clear. In the context of this paper, \u201clocal\u201d is referring to animals at their summer site of residency (e.g. where they grew their fur). But they could be called \u201clocal\u201d to other places at other times of the year. Include an explicit definition and use throughout.\r\nLine 56: Remove \u201cor are\u201d\r\nLine 60: \u201cgoals\u201d should be plural here, I think.\r\nLine 75: This seems like an improper use of \u201crelative\u201d. Reword?\r\nLine 80: What is this list of references demonstrating? Just paper that have looked at \u201cmigratory tree bats\u201d using stable isotopes (in which case Fraser et al. 2012 should be replaced with Fraser et al. 2017) or all papers looking at bat migration using stable isotopes (in which case many references are missing \u2013 much of the work from Dr. Voigt\u2019s lab, for example)? \r\nLine 103: Similar to my comment about line 52 \u2013 clarity is needed in the wording here. When you are referring to \u201csourcing\u201d bats, what time frame is being addressed?\r\nLine 152: I am not at all familiar with the details of trace element analysis and found this confusing. If some of the concentrations of some of the trace elements are calculated/inferred based entirely on the concentration of other elements, then what are these secondary (inferred) element results adding to ultimate analysis that isn\u2019t already provided by the primary (measured) ones? I don\u2019t doubt that this method is appropriate, but I would appreciate a little more explanation.\r\nLine 172: I recommend adding a #5 here (or maybe adding to #4) stating that the paper assesses the accuracy and precision of the origin assignments.\r\nLine 169/170, 173: I think it is more appropriate to say that the study is assessing variation \u201camong\u201d individuals as opposed to \u201cin\u201d them, as \u201cin\u201d suggested intra-individual variation. \r\nLine 229: I think this reference should be Fraser et al. 2017\r\nLine 269: Change \u201cbetween\u201d to \u201camong\u201d\r\nLine 294: Change \u201cis\u201d to \u201care\u201d.\r\nLine 312: Awkward sentence, reword\r\nLine 322: I think it is inferred, but I recommend explicitly stating that all precision measurements are based on >0.5 probability accuracy threshold.\r\nLine 333: Grammatical error here, reword\r\nLine 354: I recommend stating somewhere in the paper the dates when the bats that were sampled were collected. I think that the readers are referenced to the Pylant paper for this info \u2013 it would be more convenient to have the dates in the present paper.\r\nLine 370: Change \u201cuse\u201d to \u201cusing\u201d\r\nLine 388: Awkward wording, reword\r\nLine 396: Some words missing here.\r\nLine 418: Change \u201ccombing\u201d to \u201cCombining\u201d\r\nTable 3: I\u2019m uncertain about what is going on with the samples that had a 0 probability of being from the collection location and 0 precision. The table says they were \u201cincorrect\u201d. Is this experimental error? If these results are real (e.g. trace element results are correct), then what is going on? It might be interesting to mention these two points in the discussion. ", "This papers deals with the use of trace elements for assigning the likely spatial origin of bats killed at wind turbines in the US. Previously, geographic assignments were mostly conducted via the use of stable hydrogen isotope ratios in fur keratin. Here, the authors used a novel approach by analyzing trace element concentration in bat fur. Overall the paper is well written. It is widely assumed that trace elements show up in consumer tissue without any offset compared to the baseline enrichments of food items. The authors make the point that their methods allowed the assignment of 80% of the carcasses, while reducing likely geographic locations in half. It would have been instructive to do a spatial analyses based on stable hydrogen isotope ratios in fur keratin to see if the maps look similar, or to assess which of the approaches provide a more fine-scale resolution. \n\r\nLine 135: the authors should specify from which part of the torso they collected fur. Previous molting studies focused mostly on fur from the interscapular region of the back. If authors varied in the area from which fur was collected, they may vary in the time period of molt as well, since this is specific for specific parts of the body. Line 195: For geographic assignments, the authors created basemaps by extrapolating values. Usually, the  method of choice is some kriging approach. they need to specficy this. Importantly, the authors' approch does not take intra-site variation into account. Reference sampling sites are unknown, which could simulate a fine-scale resolution. yet this might be an artefact of ignoring intra-site variability. \n\r\nLine  244: the authors chose a 50% cut-off point for accepting a geographic assignment as correct. This approach is not very conservative and thus error-prone. A higher cut-off point of around >80% seems to be more desirable from my point of view. The paper starts with some alarming numbers that in Northamerica about 70 bats are killed per year and wind turbine. This is a very high number indeed and suggests that populations of affected bats will likely collapse at some point soon. The authors need to provide good documentation for these numbers.\n\r\nLine 43: the authors should specify that they are talking about the Northamerican scenario. Obviously, other species of bats are affected in Europe, Latin America etc. The authors should go through their manuscript and check if they make generic statements for bats, but mean Northamerican bats. They should specify which geographic background they are referring too, since PeerJ is an international journal (not the Midwestern Naturalist) and therefore it is read by an international readership. I suggest to broaden the geographic focus by citing international papers.\n\r\nIn the introduction, the authors should double-check if they considered all publications on bats and trace elements. One paper about mineral-drinking bats from the Amazon comes into my mind (Ghanem et al. 2013 Journal of Tropical Ecology; Hernout et al. 2016 Chemosphere, 2016 Environmental Pollution; Rahman et al. 2020 Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology among others). I am sure that there are others and therefore, it would be good to review the literature on this topic in some additional section of the introduction. "], "9886": ["The paper is written clearly and well referenced. The research question is well defined, however, the experiments are very limited in scope. No mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance are assayed nor do the authors perform any pathophysiological examinations of the offspring liver. The altered measures of hepatic function are compelling.\n\r\nFrom the materials and methods, it is unclear how long the male rats (paternal) were exposed to alcohol prior to mating. \n\r\nWhat % alcohol did the paternal rats drink?\n\r\nWhen were the body weights of the male offspring examined? Do the authors have any data prior to weaning? \n\r\nHow old were the male offspring when they were terminated? (Were these three-month-old animals as well?)\n\r\nWhy were only the male offspring examined? (why not include females as well?) Although the scope of this study is limited, the data clearly show an impact of paternal drinking on base measures of hepatic function within the male offspring. As can be seen above, I have just a few technical comments and questions for the authors. The questions posed in section 2 above need to be included in the materials and methods. ", "This study proposes that consumption of alcohol can result in transgenerational programming of metabolic disorders in offspring. The authors tested this by examining systemic biomarkers for metabolic disorders in alcohol na\u00efve offspring from rat lines selectively bred for alcohol preference and compared this with wild-type Wistar rats. Although this is an interesting approach, there are some flaws in the design and presentation/analysis of data that make it difficult to follow through to the conclusions drawn by the authors. \n\r\nRaw data was shared and the article followed the appropriate structure. Sufficient field background/context was provided and appropriate, recent references were cited. However, there was repetition of data from figures in the table (see comment below).\n\r\nGrammatical/writing style/spelling errors: Some examples where the language could be improved or there were typos include lines 52, 119, 192, 202, 227 but there are also other examples. Please review the text. Lines 38-39: The abstract states that \u201cMost markers in the alcohol-na\u00efve offspring of WHP rats were altered similarly to heavy alcohol abusers\u201d. However, there was no control group of offspring that were not alcohol-na\u00efve as they describe to draw this conclusion. Can the authors please comment on why they did not include such a group that would allow a direct comparison of measured outcomes in their study?\n\r\nWhat is the justification for only including male offspring in the study? There are well-known sex-specific differences in programming of metabolic outcomes by different maternal insults so this needs to be at least acknowledged in the discussion.\n\r\nLine 121 Methods: 8 male rat offspring from each line were used in the study, but it is unclear how many litters these came from. How many offspring were used per litter? Anything >1-2 per litter will introduce litter effects. Also, although the overall weight range for offspring was provided, what was the mean +/- SD weight of offspring within each group?\n\r\nStatistics: Were data sets tested for a normal distribution before using the parametric one-way ANOVA? This should be done and stated in the methods. If not normally distributed, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test should be used. Given the difference in variance in the WHP group in the triglyceride data, Welch\u2019s correction (or something equivalent) needs to be applied. Similarly for the ALT data. Although the authors state that the offspring were not directly exposed to alcohol, ethanol exposure only ceased 24h prior to mating in both males and females. This means that the last estrous cycle for females was exposed and so the final stages of oocyte growth and maturation were exposed to alcohol. Similarly, spermatogenesis was exposed to alcohol in males. 5g/kg is a high dose of EtOH for the WHP rats and could directly impact on these gametes. The authors very briefly mention this as a limitation of the study at the end of the discussion, but it is a fundamental point that impacts on whether this is a genetically inherited phenotype or purely the result of epigenetic changes to the germline in male and female breeders used for this study. Can the authors please comment further on this?\n\r\nFigures: As submitted, these are not of sufficient quality for publication. The labels on the X and Y axes are unclear, as are the axes labels. Graphs within each figure should be designated as A) and B) and referred to in the figure legend. It is convention to arrange the data with the control group, in this case the Wistar rats, to the left of the graph and then treatments of increasing severity to the right. Therefore, these figures should have data columns rearranged as Wistar, WLP, WHP. Figures should graph mean +/- SD (or SEM) rather than 95% confidence interval and provide the n numbers for each group. The box to represent the mean is not required, as the column graph already does this. The Y-axis should have the origin at 0. The p values for the significant differences shown in the Figures needs to be indicated (i.e. different symbols for P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001 etc). \n\r\nTable: Data for glucose, ALT, triglycerides and GGT should be removed as they are already presented in Figures 1 and 2.\n\r\nSupp file: Raw data should show units for all measures and define all abbreviations for clarity. Why is glucose and ASPAT data for the WHP group not shown to 1 decimal place, as per the other groups? There is not enough data presented here to warrant a full publication. Perhaps a brief report? ", "The manuscript is well written, in clear English. There are only a few minor typographical and grammatical errors.\n\r\nThe introduction provides context. I think it would be useful to include a brief description of the scale of the problem for humans. For example, are there appropriate references that could be cited in terms of the number of children with developmental issues resulting from Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders? \n\r\nIn the table, the alignment of the p-values for the first two rows makes these a little unclear.\n\r\nFor both figures, the text on the axes (including axis titles) is narrow and very difficult to read. A different font should be used. In addition, the symbols to denote statistically significant results are too small to be easily seen and interpreted.\n\r\nIn general, the results are clear and relate to the stated aims. However, I believe the authors could have included a clear hypothesis. The purpose of the studies is clear, and the authors describe the importance of understanding effects of alcohol abuse. As noted already, a clear hypothesis would be helpful.\n\r\nIn the introduction, the authors state that (line 71): \u201cPaternal alcohol intake during the preconception period induces a spectrum of health problems and alters gene expression in rodent offspring.\u201d However, in their experimental design (line 111): \u201c[all parents].. were mated 24 hours after the last ethanol consumption and subsequent offspring were produced. The parents were not intoxicated at the time of mating.\u201d Does this mean that both male and female parents consumed alcohol prior to mating? In that case, presumably the authors were not attempting to distinguish between paternal and maternal effects. I think this should be made clear, because in the introduction both maternal and paternal effects are described. Is there a reason why either maternal or paternal effects were not investigated, rather than having both?\n\r\nMethods\n\r\nAnimal study:\r\nThe animal studies generally appear to have been carried out carefully and appropriately. For example, it is reassuring (line 115) that the rats were handled by the same experimenters for at least 30 days before blood sampling. \n\r\nThere are a few items I think should be addressed:\n\r\nLine 101: On what basis did the authors choose 8 animals per group? Had some form of power analysis been undertaken? If so, what data was this based on? If not, why not? Did the authors have prior data to suggest 8 was sufficient?\n\r\nMethods, line 127: Centrifugation is reported as 4500 rpm. Please report this as x g.\n\r\nThe authors describe analysis of both serum and plasma, but they only report on collection of serum. Were both serum and plasma collected, or were all analyses only done using serum?\n\r\nIn general, the statistical methods seem appropriate. My question is with the use of the Newman-Keuls test; one of the assumptions for this test is that the observations are independent. Can the authors comment on whether, for example, AST and ALT levels can be considered independent? If not, would another post-hoc analysis be more appropriate in this case? My main issue with the discussion is that, in the introduction and discussion, it is noted that there are potential epigenetic mechanisms relating to effects of parental alcohol consumption on outcomes in offspring, and that seems to be an important factor in the observed results. The authors also note that these may be a subject for further studies. Some explanation of why no genetic or epigenetic outcomes were assessed in the current study would be helpful. Given these were identified as possibly important, it would have been helpful to include them. Do the authors plan to investigate such mechanisms?\n\r\nLines 181 to 183, the authors mention increased leptin levels in a previous study, but don\u2019t link this to their current study. How might this be related to the current results?\n\r\nThe authors comment that the unexpected change in GGT might be due to different epigenetic mechanisms (line 223). Other than the single reference they cite, are there any other studies to support this, or which describe other mechanisms which may be relevant? If so, these should be included. "], "9817": ["I find the manuscript mostly clear and unambiguous. I note some areas that could use clarity in that they may be missing a word, need greater or less explanation.  It may be a bit more editorial than necessary.  Additionally, I list a few questions regarding the introduction below.  References and background seem sufficient, unless noted below.  \n\r\nQuestions regarding the introduction:\r\nCould the authors explain the advantage of using a motile strain of green algae vs. non motile?  I\u2019d like to know if it is the novelty of being able to expand the species of unicellular algae that can be studied, using a well-known model organism, etc. \u2013 I see that this is in the discussion, but I think it is helpful to have a brief reference in the introduction as well.\r\nIs there evidence for the available kits not working well? (ie. did your group test them? Survey K16 teachers?)\n\r\nWriting clarity:\r\nLines 23-25:  awkward wording, suggestions in red: These kits are expensive, can be applied to only non-motile algae, and provide protocols that lack detailed specifics for trouble shooting and does not provide customization guidelines for different grade levels.\r\nLines 47-49: awkward wording, suggestions in red:  Our comparative studies of photosynthesis and cellular respiration in the10E35 and in 4A+ strains showed that 10E35 relatively has a higher respiration rate and a lower photosynthetic rate than 4A+.\r\n Line 90: maybe add \u201cfun and engaging way\u201d to sound more technical?\r\nLine 93: \u201cconduct their own independent experiments\u201d \u2013 this shows the activity is not just a \u2018cookie cutter\u2019 lab.\r\nLine 95: remove \u201cin\u201d before \u201cin dark\u201d\r\nLines 98-100:  It seems redundant to have both \u201cfunctionally uncharacterized\u201d and \u201cunknown function\u201d in this sentence.  \r\nLines 105-107:  Add a statement that acknowledges that cellular respiration is still going on when the cells are in the light, but the net production of O2/use of CO2 from photosynthesis vastly outweighs the O2 consumption/CO2 release during cellular respiration (a very common misconception is that cellular respiration doesn\u2019t occur in the light)\r\nLines 113-116:  this is just a very long sentence. Maybe according to grade level, availability of resources, and allow better time management? I appreciate the level of detail that went into validating methods for this new teaching tool. I have a few questions below and some suggestions for clarity for the materials/methods provided for those using this for their own teaching.\n\r\nFor clarification \u2013 when referring to biological replicate \u2013 you are meaning 3 separate replications of the experiment, each with 3 internal replicates?  Apologies, I got lost in the large amount of data presented in the supplemental data files.  If this is not the case, I would suggest having more replicates to strengthen your findings.\n\n\r\ndx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bgpyjvpw/ Are there copyright issues with having the protocol previously published?   \n\r\nText_S1\r\nItem 21: aluminum foil\r\nItem 30: it seems that calling it a hemocytometer or counting chamber might be more flexible to users? \n\r\nText_S2\r\nIn order to have the greatest possible flexibility to educators likely working on a tight budget or who may already have some of these supplies, it would be helpful to have a disclaimer with the supply list that there may be other vendors for the general supplies that are cheaper or that they already work with.  \r\nThe easiest way to do this is adding a column to the left that has the generic term for the item (ie. 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, yarn, disposable inoculating loops and needles, hemocytometer, etc.) as they may already have these items/be able to find cheaper. For example, the Tygon E3603 laboratory tubing is $211 (I realize you get a ton of tubing, but maybe a school would only want a small amount and look to pick it up at a hardware store) and it could be broadly represented by providing the dimensions. \n\r\nIt may be beneficial to provide a basic protocol on how to use a hemocytometer in a teaching setting? Again, this could be a supplemental text, similar to S1 and S2. Analysis of data appears robust (provided the replicates are as stated in section 2) and statistically sound. A few specific comments:\n\r\nLines 280-282:  I don\u2019t typically see p values referred to as percentages in scientific papers?  Additionally, some of this information regarding the type of tailed test could be removed to condense the results and included in the figure legends (and kept in the data analysis section of the methods) to condense the text in the results.\n\r\nThinking of this article in terms of describing teaching activities, it would be helpful to have a figure/supplemental text for specifically trouble shooting common problems. \n\r\nI think in terms of audience that teachers using this activity would benefit from the separation of technical details from the learning activities, pre-class assignments/background, assessments aligned to learning goals. Perhaps this could be combined with trouble shooting and supplies into a single supplemental text that is information on teaching?\n\r\nSome of the items in the discussion, such as customization by grade level, could be in their own figure to highlight and provide more options (as it sounds like you have them with 14 other activities!) - this could be similar to Table 9. This manuscript describes a holistic picture \u2013 using basic scientific research to create engaging activities for K4-16 students.  I very much appreciate that this work was generated in collaboration with high school and undergraduate students.  \n\r\nThis manuscript has a huge amount of data!  For me, there is important information that has two broad audiences and you will not be able to reach them in a single manuscript.  Review instructions state that decisions are not made based on any subjective determination of niche audience, so this may be out of line, but the work seems like 2 different manuscripts that differ on scope and audience:  1) a methods paper providing all data (potentially include data from verification of the other developed activities?) with optimizing this measure of photosynthesis and cellular respiration - color change, pH, time course experiments, and statistical analysis \u2013 geared towards the broader scientific community and fitting in the PeerJ journal, and 2) a teaching module designed for K4-16 educators that has the protocols, and much less technical information (suggestions include International Journal of STEM Education, Frontiers in Education: STEM Education, American Biology Teacher).\n\r\nIf I am incorrect with regards to my assessment of the scope of PeerJ, I would advise a greater separation between teaching-specific information (simplicity and clarity) and basic data.   If PeerJ looks for this type of comprehensive work, I applaud having a platform that is open access and can appeal to multiple, historically separated, audiences. ", "Here, the authors designed a useful and inexpensive protocol as a tool to teach in a fun and easy way the basic concepts of photosynthesis. Work is of great importance at the educational/academic level. However, some points can be improved, such as the ones I point out below:\r\n-I suggest deepening in the basic concepts of the photosynthesis process and highlight its biological importance. This could help you to strengthen your work justification. \r\n-I suggest a change in the order of information in the introduction section. Line 87 to 101 is about your results, so, I think that this information should appear after line 110.\r\n-There is information that doesn't have references, please include the original works from which that information was taken. i.e., lines 103, 107, 334, 541.\r\n-The link that you provide for \u201cCarolina QuickTips Making Algae Beads\u201d reference doesn't work, please check it.\r\n-It's highly recommended that the figures show all the necessary data to can understand them even without seeing the figure legend. In this regard, I suggest including some missed information in the figures. For example, in Fig. 1, please indicates which vials correspond to DI or tap water; Fig 2, please indicates the concentrations of the beads, etc. For more details please check the attached pdf file.\r\n-Tables 1 to 7 are repeated or complementary information of figures, thus, I suggest sending them to supplementary material. The information obtained in this investigation has very educational and academic significance, which will be helpful for many educators and institutions. \r\nThe research question was well defined and I think that the methods used were appropriate. Also, these were described in detail. I only have a few suggestions:\r\n-Considering the nature of your investigation and intending to facilitate the reading of your results, I suggest adding one figure to show the color-scale expected when you use the pH indicators as the bicarbonate indicator and the phenol red solution.\r\n-I suggest describing that phenol red solution is used as a pH indicator too, as a bicarbonate indicator (line 236).   \r\n-For the evaluation of the effect of cell density in line 234, I suggest writing the two concentrations of beads used.\n\r\nAbout the data analysis, I appreciate that you provide all the statistical analysis, however, I found them difficult to read. I suggest founding a better way to describe them. For instance, you can consider the way you describe it on lines 378-379. In this example, you summarize the information and put them in parentheses. Also, consider that it's not mandatory to describe all the numeric data obtained in your statistical analysis. Because you provide all your analysis in detail in supplementary material; you can always refer to that. I consider that all the experiments here described were well performed, and the results are supported by statistical analysis. The conclusions are well stated. Please refer to the attached file for more details. ", "Overall, the paper has a logical flow of ideas and is self-contained.  There are some grammatical issues in the paper, in particular those around use of tense.  The Background section of the Abstract would benefit from an additional sentence connecting the ideas from sentence1 to 2 (lines 20-23).  The third sentence in the Abstract Background has grammatical problems and would benefit from the use of colons and semicolons (lines 23-25). It is unclear to the rationale for including the last sentence of the Abstract Background (lines 28-31). The article is missing in the second sentence of the Methods portion of the Abstract (lines 24-36).  There are grammatical issues with the last sentence of the Abstract Methods (lines 36-39).  Tense and verb-subject agreement issues in the second sentence of the Results section of the Abstract (lines 41-44).  The fourth and last sentences of the Abstract Results section are a different tense from the rest of the section (lines 45-47, 50-52).  The first sentence of the Introduction needs commas separating the coordinating adjectives and the sentence ends with a phrase that is not grammatically correct (lines 55-56).  The second sentence of the Introduction is a run on and would benefit from being split into two (lines 56-60). These are some of the initial edits that should be made.  \n\r\nIn the Introduction section, BIO-RADs \u201cPhotosynthesis and Cellular Respiration Kit for General Biology\u201d should be added to the list of currently available commercial kits, as it offers the most comprehensive activity guidelines and includes detailed troubleshooting prompts (lines 60-64, 70-72).  It is unclear what the advantage would be of using motile versus non-motile algae for photosynthesis and respiration assays (lines 67-70).  Authors should articulate the rationale for use of Chlamydomonas over Chlorella, as the commercial kits use the latter.  Related, the authors should explain the advantage of making the beads over purchasing pre-made beads, such as the ones available from BIO-RAD.  Given the number of additional reagents and time needed for making the beads, it is unclear if this protocol is more cost effective in comparison to the BIO-RAD kit, which one can purchase for $181 in the US.  The author\u2019s should include a detailed cost comparison to support this claim.  The authors should read Canbay, Kose, and Oncel (2018) for a published protocol for making algae beads using Chlamydomonas (lines 67-68).   \n\r\nThe figures are extensive and well organized.  For the sake of reducing confusion in your target audience (K4-12 teachers), it is recommended that the hand-written labels on the glass vials be cropped out.  Given the importance of subtle color changes, the images should have a consistent white-balance applied.  The authors are encouraged to look at Figure 2(A), specifically. It is unclear if the focus of this article is the modification of existing protocols for use with Chlamydomonas or the use of this technique as part of a teaching module.  If the former, then I would encourage the author\u2019s to read the paper by Canbay, Kose, and Oncel (2018) that describes production and analysis of immobilizing Chlamydomonas in beads.  The author\u2019s should describe how their protocol differs and/or is superior to the protocol described in the 2018 paper.  If the latter, then it is unclear why the author\u2019s would choose to include a mutant strain that is not available from the Chlamy Stock Center.  The authors do include a list of strains that are available, but results from this activity using those strains was not provided (lines 544-547).  For a K6-12 teacher, it will be difficult for them to know what expected results are.  The authors can provide a table or figure describing expected outcomes using exemplar strains available from the Chlamy Stock Center.  \n\r\nIn the \u201cPreparation of Chlamydmomonas\u2026\u201d subsection, the URLs do not work because of the inclusion of the forward slash at the end of the link (lines 160 and 166).  The chemical analysis of the \u201ctap water\u201d should be included to define \u201ctap water\u201d for this study and confirm that chemicals that would modify photosynthesis/respiration, such as Acetate or Sulfur-containing compounds, are not present. This paper modifies a published protocol and applies it to existing activities with a new twist, which is the plastic tubing \u201cbracelets\u201d.  The tubing allows for better visualization of the pH changes due to the activity of organisms in individual beads, in comparison to glass vials or microcentrifuge tubes.  The \u201cbracelet\u201d modification is meant to capture the attention of students, and this should be effective in doing so, however, data was not provided.  The existing, commercially-available beads can also be repackaged into this \u201cbracelet\u201d form.  The authors sufficiently addressed the caveats of the plastic tubing. \r\n Given the number of institutions this protocol has been used at, the inclusion of student and teacher opinions would have strengthened the argument that the learning module is engaging.  The authors also claim that this protocol is most cost-effectives than existing protocols or kits.  The authors should include a detailed list of all reagents and equipment required, with their respective cost of use, to support this claim. "], "9720": ["The manuscript by Zhou et al. describes the effects of n-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the oxidative stress- and inflammation-induced hepatotoxicity of polychlorinated biphenyl 52 (PCB 52) in two cell lines. \n\r\nThe manuscript and graphics are clear, the structure of the manuscript is appropriate. For more clear understanding, I recommend to make a scheme of genes and respective proteins and their connections (e.g., Keap1/Nrf2 regulating Hmox1 etc) to illustrate the findings of the second part of the manuscript (Figs 3 and 4).\n\r\nThere is a remarkable overlap with the previous publication by the same authors (Wang et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2018.03.002) in terms of overall approach, cell lines and methods. In the previous publication, authors showed the toxicity of PCB 52 to two cell lines, the ability of PCB 52 to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that 3-Methyladenine suppressed ROS. This part is very similar to the first part of the current manuscript. Authors mentioned their previous paper, mostly in the context of PCB 52-induced hepatotoxicity, but they did not explain clearly, what are the knowledge gaps and what is the main hypothesis of the current manuscript compared to the published paper. Also, it would be useful to discuss their current gene expression and Western blot results in the context of the previous findings. The research hypothesis is unclear. \r\nMethods are mostly well described, only some details are missing (source and passage number of the cell lines; validation of the antibodies). The interpretations that are based on the results of Figs 3 and 4 are inconclusive. For example, in my view, the statement on the \"silencing of keap1/Nrf2 pathway\" is too speculative. There is no down-regulation of respective mRNAs (Fig 3) and no convincing proof of silencing. In addition, the data on Hmox1 expression on mRNA vs protein level and the explanation of authors is not convincing and should be supported by further experiments. ", "The article structure is in a good shape. The experimental design is reasonable. The results are conclusive, but more experiments can be done to better understand the mechanisms. In this manuscript, the authors investigated the effects of NAC to mitigate the hepatotoxicity mediated by PCBs. Pretreatment with NAC was able to ameliorate the oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in hepatocytes triggered by PCBs. Evidenced by the genes and proteins expression profiles, the authors concluded that the hepatotoxicity was induced mainly through the TLR4-mYD88 pathway, but not Nrf2 pathway. The data presentation is clear, but more discussion is needed to discriminate the results. Some detailed comments for the authors to address.\n\r\n1.\tThe authors used two hepatocyte lines, one from rat and one from human. The responses in these two cell lines are similar but not the same. What is the rationale to use these two cell lines? The authors should discuss the results. \n\r\n2.\tThe names of the genes should be consistent throughout the manuscript. \n\r\n3.\tIn this study, NAC was pretreated with the cells. How about co-exposure of PCB52 with NAC? NAC has a short therapeutic time window evidenced by some in vivo studies. It will be interesting to perform experiments in vitro to understand the best therapeutic time for NAC.\n\r\n4.\tThe authors found a significant upregulation of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression, which indicated the activation of NF-\u03baB. The role of NF-\u03baB activation as down-stream of TLR signaling is implicated in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and assist in the manifestation of inflammation. The authors are encouraged to check the NF-\u03baB activation (phospho-p65) by western blotting.\n\r\n5.\tTLR signaling and Nrf2 pathway may crosstalk with each other through p62 driven autophagy for the regulation of inflammatory responses. The authors could discuss more about the communication between these two pathways. ", "In the submitted manuscript, Zhou et al. investigates the mechanism of N-acetylcysteine alleviates PCB52-induced hepatotoxicity. They find that a significant decrease in cell viability and increased ROS levels and malondialdehyde contents in PCB52-treated cells relative to the control, which may be regulated by Keap1/Nrf2 signal pathway and need further study such silencing the Keap1/Nrf2. Overall, the study contributes novel knowledge on the role of NAC in hepatotoxicity caused induced by PCB52. Meanwhile, methods and materials described with sufficient detail and information to replicate. However, there are some points that would need more explanation before publication.\n\n\r\nMajor comments:\r\n1. Why did the study choose 40 \u03bcM of PCB52 for the further experiments? Because it is the IC50 or other reasons.\n\r\n2. In figure 3, I see some error bar is so high. Is it three independent replicates or three replicates of an experiment? Why did not detect IL-8 in Rat Brl-3A cells and Sqstm1 in human L-02 cells?\n\r\n3. In figure 4, maybe it\u2019s better to show the protein band size. Because some protein bands are two bands, such as Nrf2 and Keap1.\n\r\n4. Whether it has time-dependent effect of PCB52 on Brl-3A and L-02 cells, like 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and longer?\n\r\n5. In the supplementary figure 2, different concentrations of NAC ameliorated PCB52 effects on cell viability in different degree. I wonder why 5 mM and 10 mM of NAC has lower effect than 3 mM under noncytotoxic concentrations? \n\r\n6. Are there some agonists or antagonists of Keap1/Nrf2 signal pathway for positive or negative control?\n\r\n7. In the line 132, \u201cAnd\u201d should be corrected to \u201cand\u201d. "], "9438": ["1.

Kidney transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease. However, the shortage of available organs for transplantation is a formidable challenge. Ischemia\u2013reperfusion (IR) injury is the main cause of delayed graft function in solid organ transplantation. It is inspiriting and beneficial to analyze the activities and potential pharmacological properties of preconditioning drugs (hypoxia mimetics) on preventing or limitting IR injury. In this manuscript, Dr. Eduardo Cienfuegos-Pecina and colleagues looked at the nephroprotective effect of the egg-laying defective nine homolog (EGLN) inhibitors, (S)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(S)-2HG] and succinic acid (SA) in IR injury rat. The study\u2019s conclusion showed that only (S)-2HG showed a dose-dependent nephroprotective effect at the evaluated doses, which involved the promotion of HIF-1alpha accumulation.

I think there are too many citations, 56 I think for a short paper is too many in my opinion and needs to be focused more on those that are absolutely necessary. I think figure one needs more annotation as it stands it's not possible to see what the authors are referring to in the main text. In particular figure 1b needs a ribbon above it showing the secondary structure (they have provided similar in 2b) and they should highlight residues in the active site. Figure 1c also needs annotation with some arrows pointing to salient structure referred to in the main text. I also think there is a mistake in the gradient bar should go from -8 to 0. I think the experiments are rigorous and well explained but I find it a shame that the authors have only used HDX-MS to underpin the NMR rather than use the HDX to look for rare states. In the conclusions the authors point to alternative methods that are more sensitive to rare states. However HDX-MS is sensitive to rare conformations but they haven't employed this technique to look for them. The longest labelling time is quite short and I appreciate they have concerns about auto-lysis in the enzyme. But with these short labelling times much of the protein doesn't exchange could there not be some slow EX1 exchange at longer times? Can the authors comment as to why they haven't incubated this protein for long enough to explore EX1 dynamics and potentially unearth a rare state? The findings are not particularly interesting but I still think these types of data have value and have been conducted rigorously. I think the data that has been provided is sufficient to support the conclusions except the lack of long labelling times in the HDX data. ", "The paper is well written and highly intelligible, with an introduction that clearly and interestingly focuses on the research question with exhaustive references to previous studies and to the techniques implemented. I would only suggest minor adjustments:\r\n1. Specify that room temperature is 25\u00b0C for HDX-MS experiments (line 129) since for diffraction experiments it is set to a different value, namely 297K, i.e. 24\u00b0C (line 185).\r\n2. When first using the abbreviation RT (line 182), you could specify that it stands for \u201croom temperature\u201d.\n\r\nThanking you for providing the raw data following the recommendations stated by Masson et al. (2019), I have to highlight that they show a couple of inconsistencies:\r\n1. In Table S1, the number of replicates is set to 3 while the paper states that (local) HDX experiments were performed in tetraplicate (line 166). In second place, please specify in Table S1 that the units of HDX time course is minutes and correct the sequence coverage (one extra % is present).\r\n2. In Table S1 the number of peptides is set to 106, while in Table S2 110 peptides are present and 112 peptides are declared in the manuscript for the uninhibited enzyme (line 252).\r\n3. In Table S2 the last 32 peptides do not have associated values in the columns \u201cUptake \u2013 Control Sample (D)\u201d and \u201cUptake error (SD) \u2013 Control Sample (D)\u201d. Moreover, it could be nice to have a uniform value for non-performed measurements: in fact, sometimes an empty space is left, other times \u201cNA\u201d or \u201cNaN\u201d are used. \n\r\nFigures are clear and well captioned, the only typo to be corrected is in the caption of Figure 3-C (it is referred as B instead of C). I would strongly suggest inserting the plots showing the results of the analysis described in lines 231-233 of the manuscript.\n\r\nI disagree with the statement in lines 256-257: \u201cIn the most parts of the sequence, exchange occurs on the minute time scale\u201d. I would remove the \"most\" since looking at Figure S2 the \u201cno exchange\u201d and the \u201cminute time scale\u201d situations are comparable in terms of probability to occur (maybe the \"no exchange\" situation is even more probable). As no exchange occurs for segments 119-122 and 217-227 (line 264), I would say that no exchange occurs even for other segments like 1-30, 1-31, 1-41, 2-31, 3-31. Anyway, this does not influence the overall conclusion. ", "In this study, an important enzyme for biological washing applications \u2013 savinase \u2013 is analysed to answer the hypothesis that it has a specific conformation which confers activity. Multiple biophysical approaches are brought together to yield sub-molecular resolution of structural- and thermo-dynamics: X-ray crystallographic structural models, 1-D and 2-D NMR and hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry. The study provides two alternative active and inactive conformations of the savinase structure and these are annotated with detail of the extent of conformational dynamics, resulting from covalent inactivation by PMSF irreversible inhibition. The conclusion of the study is that there are no significant differences in local or global structure to support the hypothesis that there is an alternative active conformation of savinase.\n\r\nCommunication is excellent.\r\nThe study is well connected to the immediate and wider literature. Citations were full and complete, as fast as I could determine.\r\nEnough raw, or processed data has been shared. The authors perform Student t-tests per peptide per timepoint, which is a very robust statistical treatment of the data. This is crucial to the overall objective here of sensitively comparing two states of a highly stable enzyme and, in particular, to support the finding that there are no significant differences. The study has been performed experimentally and data statistics performed to a high level.\n\r\nDetail of methods is absolutely fine, as far as I can tell. Certainly enough experimental detail is provided that the experiments could be replicated successfully. Conclusions are supported by the data, with only minor comments (see below note). Major comments:\n\r\nNo major criticisms found.\n\r\nMinor Comments:\n\r\n1.\tThe NMR and MS methods employed here are ensemble methods. Please can the authors comment on the extent that their measurements conclusively refute the existence of a sub-population of the alternative conformation that was indicated by NMR relaxation data. What fractional population would be required in order to be detected above noise in this dataset?\n\r\n2.\tI recommend adding a volcano plot of the HDX-MS data, as this would make for a simple communication of the hybrid significant differences between the savinase states \u2013 or lack thereof.

The great inter-study variability of tear protein profiles suggests that only a small proportion of tear proteins are constitutively expressed and necessary for physiological tear functions.\" Incorrect claim. Not detecting a protein by proteomics does not mean it is not expressed. In fact, at least 2779 proteins were identified by the DDA method when constructing the library. There is absolutely more proteins not detected by the authors. Please rephrase. Also please comment on the technologies used by the previous studies and what potential effects that might have on the overlaps. \n\r\nLine 216, \"These results suggest that tear proteomes may reflect the status of other tissues/organs and thus can be a window for disease biomarker discovery\" Like the author stated previously, a lot proteins are constitutively expressed, such as fibronectin etc.. Overlap with other tissues totally makes sense as these proteins are just essential to cell survival. It does not mean they can reflect status of other tissues. In fact with only 514 proteins identified, I am assuming most of these proteins are just super abundant proteins that most of cells make.  Please rephrase. \n\r\nLine 230, \" The trends in each protein abundance changes were inconsistent among the 15 pairs of tears, but 13 (0.7%) proteins showed the same trend in more than half of the sample pairs (Table 3).\" It does not make much sense by doing such comparison. This is why you do statistical test. 13 proteins having the same trend in more than half samples do not mean anything statistically. They could just go to the other extreme in the other half of the samples and would not be counted as significantly regulated proteins. If the authors really want to show proteins with same trend, please only focus on proteins that are statistically significant. This is a well-designed research and it has values for people who are studying the disease. Therefore it should be published. However, there are some flaws that need to be addressed first.

The work has been methodologically well conducted, and high technical and methodological detail is provided in Materials & methods section. Although the results obtained and data presented are robust and consistent, in general the discussion of results is quite short. Further discussion is recommended.\r\nBesides there are some inconsistences between results and discussion & conclusions. For example:\n\r\nIn paragraph 3.1, lines 212-.217, the authors indicate \u201cThese results suggest that tear proteomes may reflect the status of other tissues/organs and thus can be a window for disease biomarker discovery\u201d.

It has been repeatedly reported in previous publications and this statement is not a direct result of the work here presented.\n\r\nIn paragraph 3.2, the authors indicate that of 62 differentially expressed proteins in (A) vs (Q), authors presented in table 2 only those related with immunity. Although other ocular diseases was an exclusion criteria in the study, most of the proteins listed in table 2 have been previously reported in tear proteomics studies of dry eye (DE). I recommend authors to review the paper \u201cTFOS DEWS II Tear Film Report. Willcox,M et al. The Ocular Surface 15 (2017) for further discussion. For example in this study Annexin A1 (ANXA1), is reduced in active BDU in comparison with quiescent, but increased in ADDE and SSDE; lysozyme is decreased in both, active BDU and DE, etc...\n\r\nThe number of interindividual variations presented in Table 3 is not informative.

I recommend to perform a validation/verification step to confirm protein expression in novel tear samples.\n\r\nConclusions paragraph presents a summary of work more than conclusions. Which are the most relevant candidate biomarkers? ", "This manuscript entitled \u201cProfiling of tears proteome of patients with unilateral relapsed Behcet\u2019s disease-associated uveitis via data-independent acquisition proteomics\u201d investigates novel marker proteins on tear fluids of Behcet\u2019s disease-associated uveitis using DIA based proteomics approach. Anyi Liang et al., carried out the comparative proteomic analysis of 15 uveitis patients resulting identification of 1,797 proteins including 62 DEPs which are significantly altered in active eye compared to the opposite quiescent eye of the same patient. This result suggests potential valuable biomarkers of Behcet\u2019s disease-associated uveitis in tear fluids. There are several concerns, both in the structure/organization of the manuscript and their findings. 1) The authors compared identified proteins from tear fluids with two previous studies (in results 3.1). It is hard to understand how authors compared protein lists. This is a very critical part of your paper and needs to be explained. It makes no sense that only 1% of proteins are expressed simultaneously in tears. In the current version, the detailed comparison method are not described. It seems to be unfair comparison. For a fair comparison, download the raw data of the two papers and search using same database and parameters. \r\nYou also need an explanation for the sentence below. As you explain, the differences of expressed tear proteins among individuals should be very large, but the difference among the 15 patient's tears used in your study is not significant. This can be very confusing to readers and may mean that tear fluid cannot be used as a biomarker source. You need to have a clear explanation for this.\r\n\u201cThe great inter-study variability of tear protein profiles suggests that only a small proportion of tear proteins are constitutively expressed and necessary for physiological tear functions.\u201d (in line 202)\n\r\n2) Following question 1, why did you compare the proteins identified in DIA, not the proteins identified in DDA?\n\r\n3) In results 3.1, identified proteins in tear fluid were compared with tissue proteome data. However, there is no explanation for the comparison criteria in your manuscript. You should explain detailed criteria such as the kind of tissue you compared. Furthermore, interpretation of your data is too weak so you should describe more detailed conclusion of this data.\n\r\n4) LFQ data such as DIA, DDA must be confirmed for a subset of proteins with antibody-based assays for additional validation. LFQ will miss out on isoform abundance levels in the total proteome. \n\r\n5) The reproducibility of the DIA analysis was confirmed by the DDA data of the pooled peptides in triplicates. Although this can confirm the inter-day variation of LC-MS sensitivity, it is difficult to confirm that there is no variation in the analysis of tear fluid samples. To confirm the reproducibility of the DIA assay, show the CV (%) of retention time and intensity of the spiked iRT peptide.\n\r\n6) What is the difference between general glaucoma and Behcet's disease-related glaucoma? There is no interpretation of the results related to Behcet disease. Please describe in the discussion part.\n\r\n7) The manuscript is rather poorly organized and each section (method and results) does not serve its purpose. Especially, 3 and 4 in methods part have to be cleaned up and combined to prevent confusion for readers. In addition, the results part should be explained in more detail. 1) The amount of tear fluid sample collected from the active eye and quiescent eye in each patient and the protein per unit volume are not given. Is there any significant variation in the opposite eye?\n\r\n2) Why did the authors use HLB for desalting? \r\n\u201cOasis HLB cartridges (Waters, USA).

Please describe it exactly.\n\r\n4) Revise the wrong number with four-digit in this manuscript. 1 797 should be 1,797 in line 29.

Figure 2b the chromatogram looks like a screenshot and the line indicating the retention time of D-borneol makes the peaks hard to see. Moreover, from the legend it is not clear if c is a spectrum of D-borneol in a sample or from the NIST-library. Figure 6: the legend speaks about black and grey bars, however the bars are pink and blue. \r\nThe raw data is shared, however the link to the transcriptomics data supplied with the review material is not found in the manuscript itself. In line 204 of the results the authors talk about a reference transcriptome for mapping, but in the Material and Methods no reference transcriptome is specified. \n\r\nThe largest drawback of this research is that the core goal to identify a D-borneol synthase is purely hypothetical. While they claim to have identified two terpene synthases that are good candidates, I disagree. First of all, these enzymes were not characterized at all and terpene synthases are notorious for producing multiple products, therefore while these enzymes might produce D-borneol this might be only one terpene among many and not even the major product. This would prevent using this enzyme for biotechnological production of d-borneol without further protein engineering near impossible. The best way to improve the manuscript and support the claim that these enzymes could be used for biotechnological approaches, would be to express the two enzymes in a well-established heterologous host like E. coli and either use a metabolic engineering approach or purify protein for in vitro assays. The research tries to fill a knowledge gap, however it falls short as stated above in supporting the conclusion that this research and the investigated genes will help in the intended biotechnological approach for the production of d-borneol. Again the conclusions overstate the findings, as the two suggested genes were not characterized and might not be the searched for D-borneol synthase. The authors identified GPPS and their expression pattern (Figure 5), which enzyme was used for anotation?

", "The Introduction section does not provide accurate background information. Moreover, the authors' statements are not supported by adequate citations / references. The reviewer provides examples of statements made by the authors which need to be revised:\n\r\n1) The following statement is inaccurate: \u201cBisphosphonates inhibit the digestion of bone by causing osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis and thereby inhibit bone loss\u201d\r\n-BPs antiresorptive actions are not limited to induction of osteoclast apoptosis. BPs impair osteoclasts\u2019 ability to form a ruffled border, to adhere to the bone surface, and to synthesize protons necessary for bone resorption. Furthermore, BPs suppress osteoclast activity by decreasing osteoclast progenitor development and recruitment.\n\r\n2) The following statement is inaccurate: \u201cIn osteoporosis and Paget's disease, the most popular first-line bisphosphonates are alendronate and risedronate, but when they are ineffective or digestive tract problems develop, intravenous pamidronate may be used\u201d\r\n-IV zoledronic acid is the first-choice treatment for Paget disease because of its efficacy and ease of administration. The choice of zoledronic acid as the initial agent for most patients with active Paget disease is consistent with both the 2014 clinical practice guidelines of the Endocrine Society and the 2019 Paget's Association guidelines.\n\r\n3) The following statement is inaccurate: \u201cThey also change bone ultrastructures, e.g., they obliterate haversian canaliculi and deposit irregular and thick reversal lines\u201d\r\n-BPs have been shown to obliterate haversian canals, not haversian canaliculi.\n\r\n4) The authors make the statement, \u201cIn addition, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) may develop in patients who have used bisphosphonates long term (Marx et al. 2005; Ruggiero et al. 2004)\u201d \r\n -The authors need to address the incidence of BRONJ in patients being administered oral bisphosphonates versus IV bisphosphonates. BP route of administration critically influences the incidence of BRONJ.\r\n-The authors should cite the specific research studies which have shown that long-term use of bisphosphonates is a risk factor for BRONJ.\n\r\n5) The following statement is inaccurate: \u201cBRONJ is a microbial infection that occurs after dental extraction or surgery and constitutes a severe complication of suppurative and necrotizing osteomyelitis in jaws (Chirappapha et al. 2017; Choi et al. 2017; Park et al. 2009)\u201d\r\n-The pathophysiology of BRONJ is currently unclear. BRONJ has been attributed to infection, suppressed bone turnover, vascularity, genetic predisposition, etc. \r\n-BRONJ is not always caused by dentoalveolar surgery. BRONJ can occur spontaneously.\r\n-The current evidence does not support the view that BRONJ is a complication of suppurative and necrotizing osteomyelitis in jaws. \n\r\n6) The authors make the statement, \u201cPamidronate (pamidronate disodium or pamidronate disodium pentahydrate) is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate and used to prevent bone loss due to steroid use or to treat certain cancers with propensities for bone, such as multiple myeloma\u201d\r\n-The reviewer is unaware that pamidronate is used to treat steroid-induced bone loss. Please cite / reference the society guidelines demonstrating this clinical use.\n\r\n7) The following statement is inaccurate: \u201cDue to its ability to sequester calcium in bone, pamidronate is frequently used to treat high calcium levels\u201d\r\n-BPs do not sequester calcium in bone. BPs inhibit calcium release from bone by impairing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. \n\r\n8) The authors make the statement, \u201cFurthermore, multiple trials have shown that IP-HPLC can be used to rapidly determine multiple protein levels accurately (< \u00b15% standard deviation) and reproducibly.\u201d\r\n-The authors need to provide citations / references supporting this statement.\n\r\n9) The authors make the statement, \u201cWhen pamidronate is injected into blood vessels, it is immediately neutralized by cationic molecules like albumin and calcium and engulfed by macrophages, which suggests its various pharmacologic effects may be associated with the cellular functions of pamidronate-laden macrophages.\u201d\r\n-The reviewer is not aware that when pamidronate is injected into blood vessels, it is neutralized by albumin and calcium and engulfed by macrophages.

Experiments should have been repeated at least three times in order to have n-values = 3 per group.\r\n3) The chi-square test is not an appropriate statistical test. Chi-square test is used when evaluating the relationship between two categorical variables (i.e., race, sex, age group, educational level). The study does not evaluate categorical variables.\n\r\nThe data should be re-analyzed applying appropriate statistical analyses methods.

The integrity of leukocyte RNA indicates the same result as above, but the integrity of whole blood RNA is significantly decreased after rabbit blood is stored at 4 \u2103 for over 3 days.

", "The paper by Song and Zhou is an investigation on the feasibility of using blood samples preserved for different times at 4\u00b0C for biobanking and subsequent gene expression studies.\r\nThe language is correct, the introduction is clear and literature\u2013based, structure is in line with Peer J guidelines and figures are clear and of good quality. The present research fits with the scope of the journal.\r\nThe research question is well defined, however it is a rather well-addressed question. \r\nThe investigation was performed with good technical and ethical standards. Methods are described with a sufficient degree of detail. Most of the papers on a similar topic use room temperature blood preservation after withdrawal (the so-called bench time), and this is generally less than 8 h (see for example Hebels et al, Environmental Health Perspectives volume 121, 4, 2013). Can the authors justify the use of 4\u00b0C? Furthermore, considering how valuable are samples to be biobanked, it is difficult to imagine that a researcher would accept the risk to maintain them for longer than 8 h without freezing them. It would definitely be more acceptable to freeze them within 8 h from withdrawal (possibly after fractionation). Indeed, the Authors show that RNA purity and integrity are not significantly modified up to 3 d for whole blood and to 7 d for leukocyte RNA; however, they recognize that RNA integrity is a parameter related to ribosomal RNA, and they show a degree of variability of specific mRNAs with time. Thus, it is possible that small but relevant differences in mRNA integrity take place during the time at 4\u00b0C, that could have an impact on future gene expression studies.\r\nIt is doubtful that the observed differences in the various tested mRNAs is due to gene expression changes taking place at 4\u00b0C, as the Authors seem to suggest in the discussion (lines 295-316). It appears more likely that some mRNA degradation can take place during this time, so that the expression \u201cmRNA levels\u201d should be used in place of \u201cgene expression\u201d here.

The paper describes diligent findings on information about effects of preservation duration at 4 \u00b0C for different preservation durations, from 1 hour to 7 days, on the quality of RNA in rabbit blood specimens. This paper addresses an interesting question: whether the quality of RNA from whole blood and/or leukocytes isolated from rabbit blood in regards to the effects of preservation duration at 4 \u00b0C could be a choice approach to valuable source of RNA for profiling gene expression. Strong point: \n\r\nThe authors assessed that the purity of whole blood RNA and leukocyte RNA does not induce significant change after blood is stored at 4 \u00b0C for different preservation durations. Otherwise, the integrity of whole blood RNA and leukocyte RNA  is degraded after a preservation duration for more than 3 days at 4 \u00b0C . The gene expression, especially of whole blood RNA, can decrease over the increased preservation duration.

The author\u2019s description of diverse protocols with steps that have been inherited from earlier versions of uncertain utility to their current application, intermixed and often indistinct from elements critical to the success of the experiment, certainly resonated with my experience in this field in the past 15 years. Thus, I think the article will find a significant and interested audience.  The author\u2019s execution of this aim is largely successful in the manuscript. \r\nThe subject matter of RNA FISH taken alone is much to broad to easily cover comprehensively, even if the focus is just on protocols.  Still, I find the treatment a little dated, as it misses a significant amount of innovation in RNA FISH protocols in the last 5 years which I think have made a dramatic impact on this field.  I would recommend the authors to look into some of these works.  I believe the push to higher throughput multiplexed detection and sensitive deep tissue detection has put greater pressure to optimize the protocols, and that these improvements to some degree benefit ALL forms of RNA FISH. Many of the modern protocols are variations of the earlier protocol varieties the authors already discuss, but I think their more stringent applications (and more recent use) can be used as a proxy to distinguish which protocols aspects are better.

N/A this is a review -- see comments above for minor suggestions of accuracy. Young and colleagues present a timely review that focuses on an important and largely unaddressed theme, a rational explanation of the diverse protocols for RNA FISH. The author\u2019s description of diverse protocols with steps that have been inherited from earlier versions of uncertain utility to their current application, intermixed and often indistinct from elements critical to the success of the experiment, certainly resonated with my experience in this field in the past 15 years. Thus, I think the article will find a significant and interested audience.  The author\u2019s execution of this aim is largely successful in the manuscript. \r\nThe subject matter of RNA FISH taken alone is much to broad to easily cover comprehensively, even if the focus is just on protocols.  Still, I find the treatment a little dated, as it misses a significant amount of innovation in RNA FISH protocols in the last 5 years which I think have made a dramatic impact on this field.  I would recommend the authors to look into some of these works.  I believe the push to higher throughput multiplexed detection and sensitive deep tissue detection has put greater pressure to optimize the protocols, and that these improvements to some degree benefit ALL forms of RNA FISH. Many of the modern protocols are variations of the earlier protocol varieties the authors already discuss, but I think their more stringent applications (and more recent use) can be used as a proxy to distinguish which protocols aspects are better.  In particular, recent work from the Singer, Raj, Cai, Zhuang, Pelkmans, and Gregor labs.   \r\nsome examples:  Eng, \u2026, Cai,. Nat.

However, characteristics such as the GC content, the propensity to form secondary structures, the overall length and specificity and probe quantity and quality must be considered\u201d.  The recent proliferation of purely synthetic probes in place of cloning derived probes has provided much greater control of characteristics such as GC content and the propensity to form secondary structures.

", "(1)\tThe manuscript fails to include the recent development of the RNA-FISH technique. As a promising technique for RNA labeling and imaging, RNA-FISH has been improved in different ways to increase the throughput (e.g., Eng et al., Nature, 2019; Shah et al., Cell, 2018) and signal level (e.g., Marras et al., PNAS, 2019; Choi et al., Development, 2018). These new versions of RNA-FISH may point to the future direction of the field. Without mentioning these recent advances and discussing their technical aspects, the manuscript looks a bit outdated. Hence, the authors should include these new versions of RNA-FISH technique in their paper.\n\r\n(2)\tFigure caption is missing for Figure 1.

For example, the term \u201cChromogenic ISH\u201d only appears in Figure 1, but not in the main text. With a figure caption, it is hard to understand what the term means.\n\r\n(3)\tIn lines 83 and 415, \u201c(Figure 1)\u201d and \u201c(Figure 2)\u201d should be \u201c(Fig. 1)\u201d and \u201c(Fig. 2)\u201d, respectively, according to the Instructions for Authors (https://peerj.com/about/author-instructions/#figures).\n\r\n(4)\tIn Tables 1 and 3, the temperature of each step is not listed. The manuscript lacks a summary or conclusion part. A review article should not merely be a collection of previously published papers. As required by PeerJ, a Literature Review should have a conclusion part identifying unresolved questions/gaps/future directions about the field (https://peerj.com/about/author-instructions/#literature-review-sections). In this part, the authors may summarize their review of the technical aspects of RNA FISH and provide their view on the future development of the FISH technique. This will help the readers quickly understand the main points of the paper. This paper reviews the technical aspects of RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which serves as a powerful tool for visualizing the spatial distribution of specific RNA species in cultured cells, tissue sections or whole mount preparations. Focusing on the core steps of RNA-FISH procedure, i.e., tissue preparation, hybridization, and post-hybridization washing, the authors summarize reagents and experimental conditions commonly used in these steps and explain their functional roles. Also, the authors discuss probe selection and necessary controls for a robust FISH experiment.\n\r\nIn recent years, RNA imaging techniques, including RNA FISH, have been reviewed by multiple papers (Tutucci et al., Annu. Rev. Biophys., 2018; Pichon et al., Mol. Cell, 2018), most of which focused on comparing different RNA labeling and imaging techniques. However, a detailed review of the technical aspects of RNA FISH (or other RNA imaging techniques), which are critical for the success of an experiment, is still lacking. Hence, the information provided by this paper may help a wide range of investigators using RNA-FISH in their research. I think the manuscript is suitable for PeerJ. There are, though, some points that I would like the authors to address before publication:\n\r\n(1)\tThe manuscript lacks a summary or conclusion part.

Hence, the authors should include these new versions of RNA-FISH technique in their paper. \n\r\n(3)\tIn some places of the paper, the same content has been reviewed twice, which is not necessary. For example, in \u201cThe development of RNA-FISH and smFISH\u201d part, the first paragraph reviews the development of different RNA-FISH methods, while the second paragraph more reviews explicitly the development of different FISH probes. However, since the main difference between various RNA-FISH methods is their probes, the contents of the two paragraphs are highly overlapping. The authors should combine the two paragraphs and review the history of different RNA-FISH methods based on the development of different types of probes.\n\r\n(4)\tIn the last paragraph of the \u201cHybridization\u201d part, where the authors discuss the hybridization conditions, the statement \u201cthree parameters regarding hybridization: salt concentration; hybridization temperature; and duration of hybridization\u201d is not complete, as the pH value of the hybridization buffer is also an important parameter to affect the stringency of the hybridization (Choi et al., Development, 2016; Mannheim, Biochemicals Catalog, 1992).

", "In this Review, Young et al. present a brief historical account on the development of the most used RNA-FISH techniques, followed by a description of the most typical protocol steps, with emphasis on the rationale behind the use of the most commonly used reagents and procedures.\n\r\nA review like this could be of use as an introduction for researchers that are interested in using RNA FISH but do not have prior experience in method development. In that sense, I think this article is worthwhile publishing. Below I list a series of comments for the authors to consider before publishing this piece in PeerJ:\n\r\n1.\tLines 110-111: \u201cSince these seminal studies, the applications of smFISH have expanded to visualize differential gene expression within heterogeneous cells\u201d. I think that using the term \u201cheterogeneous cells\u201d makes this sentence ambiguous. I think that the authors could change it to \u201c(\u2026) visualize gene expression heterogeneity at the single-cell level\u201d.\n\r\n2.\tLines 112-113: The authors cite Shalek et al. 2014 when they talk about RNA-FISH multiplexing. But that reference uses mainly single-cell sequencing, using RNA-FISH only as a secondary confirmatory technique, I, therefore, think that this reference can be omitted.\n\r\n3.\tFollowing comment #2, the authors mention smFISH multiplexing but they do not cite the most up-to-date RNA-FISH multiplexed techniques, such as MERFISH (Chen et al., Science, 2015, Moffitt et al., Science, 2018) or d seqFISH (Lubeck et al. Nat. meth., 2014; Eng et al, Nature, 2019). I think it is fitting to cite such techniques as the final evolution of RNA-FISH.\n\r\n4.\tLines 122-123: \u201cBoth methods had issues producing signal to noise ratios that could allow reliable quantification of transcript expression\u201d. This phrase is vague. What \u201cissues\u201d is the author referring to? This could be solved by stating explicitly the problem of using a single fluorophore per mRNA (or a few, in case of antibodies): that probe binding to mRNA cannot be distinguished from non-specific binding to other cellular structures. smFISH allows obtaining the absolute number of molecules, while previous methods only could measure relative expression levels.\n\r\n5.\tLines 125-126: The authors mention self-quenching. Where do they get that reference? I know that Raj et al., Nat. meth., 2008 mention self-quenching as a drawback of the method used by Femino et al. and they cite Randolph et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1997. The authors should cite either of those sources (or any source they used to back up their claim). Also, the authors may want to mention that probably the most important reason this method is not widely adopted is the difficulty to create such probes (As mentioned in Raj et al., Nat. meth., 2008). Self-quenching by itself does not avoid the method from reaching single-molecule resolution (as evidenced by the many works from the Singer lab)\n\r\n6.\tLines 130-132: The authors found that this approach was more effective in labeling individual mRNA targets compared to traditional probes that spanned the full length of the transcript\u201d. Here again, the language is vague. What do the authors mean by \u201cmore effective\u201d? Also, which comparison the authors mean? I do not remember Raj et al. 2008 making such a comparison. Also, please provide a reference when making claims.\n\r\n7.\tLines 135-137: The authors mention Stellaris as a product that was created based on smFISH technology. I find that only mentioning a single product seems to be unnecessary favoritism. I imagine there are other commercial products that are used for other types of RNA-FISH. If this is the case, It would be better the authors add a table for a series of technologies or remove the reference to commercial products altogether.\n\r\n8.\tLine 270: \u201d(\u2026) is time well spent\u201d. It seems too colloquial and vague. It would be better to say explicitly what can be improved, for example, \u201cit is necessary to obtain a high signal to noise ratio\u201d or something like that, depending on what the authors want to emphasize.\n\r\n9.\tLine 284: \u201c(\u2026) reduces the annealing temperatures of nucleic acid strains\u201d. That\u2019s confusing. The annealing temperature is an experimental parameter that can be varied. A more appropriate parameter to mention would be the free energy of binding (which depends on the temperature).\n\r\n10.\tLines 343-345: It is true that the salt concentration is generally kept constant. Temperature is changed often, but also formamide concentration is often changed (see multiple reviews from Raj lab.)\n\r\n11.\tLine 426: I would suggest the authors to add references to works where the authors use the comparison of the foci intensity in samples with or without the transcript of interest (for example, Skinner et al. Nat. Protoc., 2013) or the presence of a single foci intensity peak (Trcek et al., Nat. Protoc., 2012)\n\r\n12.\tFinally, the review would benefit from a \u201cConclusion\u201d or \u201cDiscussion\u201d section. Also, it would also benefit from a section describing, even briefly, the type of analysis researchers perform with the data (particularly for smFISH).

I\u2019ll assume for the sake of arguments that the all intramolecular Ca-Ca pair distance variations (score = media (distance(Ca-Ca))/stdev) is the UMF.\n\r\n- Figure 6 and its description do not contribute much to understand protein movement or morphness. For instance, linear dependency could means that proteins did not suffer any rotation or large motions of some of their parts, like it is observed in multidomain proteins. In single-domain proteins, it is less likely that such movements take place, hence the no-linearity may emerge from low resolution at the N and C terminus end of the protein, that may vary from one crystal structure to another. This level of analysis may improve the level of relevance of their score that can capture these properties. - The methods do not provide sufficient information to understand or reproduce how the authors calculate the UMF. For instance, the procedure to calculate Ca-Ca distance is not described. The reference from Anzai referred to another work of this group by Asano and colleagues, where they state that \"The overall pairwise root-mean-squared deviation and correlation coefficient were obtained by Discovery Studio Visualizer 3.1 (Accelrys Inc.) and pca-excel 1.0 (ss-nakano Inc.), respectively\". Discover Studio Visualizer is commercial software that although is freely available, does not specify the type of distance that calculates. There are several distances that can be obtained from an euclician space (see for instance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance). The most common one is referred to as euclidian distance, which is a 2-norm distance. In this case, the authors have not specified what type of distance they used for their studies. This is an important aspect since from the description of their work, their interest is to measure the distribution of variations. For that goal, there are different approaches that may be appropriate, such as divergences. If the authors are not using that distance, it would be relevant to justify why to use the Euclidian distance. This is relevant for instance, in terms of computational efficiency, there are important differences on how fast these distances can be computed. If the database growth surpasses the current capacity of their method, this may become an issue later on and perhaps the authors would need to change their distance. It is expected that changing the distance may change their results and consequently their conclusions. Thus, it is fundamental for the authors to make a better description of their procedure to compute distance and make an appropriate justification of their procedure.\n\r\n- The previous point is relevant for the results presented in figure 3. The plots show a Poisson-like distribution, a form of normal distribution for small sets (see for instance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution). This distribution is possible to be induced by the way the authors processed their data. That is, the authors used the media of the Ca-Ca distances and divided this by the stdev; both media and stdev, are parameters of normal distributions.  As the authors claim in favor of the DSA \u201cthe amount of numeral usage is far more than the pair-wise based analysis\u201d; with more numbers to analyze, it is feasible to analyze the distribution of their values (Ca-Ca distance values) to test whether these follow the observed distribution in Figure 3 or not. If these distances do not follow the distribution of Figure 3, then their treatment of this data is likely inducing a behavior that is not present in the original data. This in turn may have an effect on the author\u2019s results and conclusions. Hence, it is important to show this analysis of distances to test for the lack of induction of their method.\n\r\n- Furthermore, the Ca-Ca distance distribution would allow for better interpretation of their data. For instance, in the section \u201cDistribution plot\u201d, the authors described how the UMF values vary from a minimum of 15 to a maximum; however, there is no interpretation of these values to the protein itself. For instance, contiguous Ca-Ca distances are usually between 6-12 A apart; hence the limit for UMF=15 is probably the consequence of this range. The authors also mentioned the value close to 0 for unstructured proteins. Yet, considering that UMF=DSA, we can conclude that for unstructured proteins, the DSA would have large average distances and potentially low stdev, hence, that value would tend to be large not close to cero. But looking into their Ca-Ca distance may solve this apparent discrepancy. The interpretation of their results may focus on the protein structure and not so much on the UMF value itself. For instance, since the distance between alpha carbons cannot be extended too much, it seems that the upper limit of the DSA depends on how small the stdev is. Understanding why different structures of the same protein maintain the same orientation of each pair of alpha carbons may depend on the crystallographic conditions used. If the different structures were crystallized with the same procedure and obtained very similar resolutions, this may explain this small variation. The authors do not discuss this. - The term morphable and its score are not clear what they try to capture from the protein structure. Considering the formula and their description, it seems that the authors\u2019 interest is to capture the structural divergence between different experimental conditions used to solve the same protein. If that is the case, I would expect a clear relationship between their UMF score and a similar one derived from the crystallographic B (thermal) factors. However, the authors did not present any data to show this possible relationship. In any case, it is important for authors to show that their values reflect some aspect of the experiments to solve the structure, the nature of the protein or both.  The current work lacks any analysis in this regard. For instance, the authors could extract information that is part of the PDB entries, such as CAVEAT, COMPND, SOURCE, AUTHOR among others, to infer how different the conditions used to solve two or more structures were. If there is a correlation between these experimental differences and the UMF, then this last score would be a valuable resource to resume lots of experimental information. The same applies for structural changes of the protein that reflect the structural flexibility of the protein as noted in the previous point.

", "Peng et al. show that there is a strong gene expression correlations among genes related to EMT, immunity, and stromal profile in the context of osteosarcoma using publicly available datasets. Interestingly, these gene expressions are negatively correlated with tumor purity. The authors also stratified patient survival data and found that EMT is more predictive of poor survival (OS, RFS) than immune-related genes and that combining their signatures can provide better prognostic value. They also suggest that EMT gene expression is generally derived from stromal cells rather than epithelial cancer cells. \n\r\nWhile the manuscript contain commendable elements (i.e., providing insights of gene activity in osteosarcoma), the current study heavily relied on gene expression profiles and patient survival correlations, which may or may not be directly coupled physiologically.

However, I should note that this be done cautiously as the authors did not couple their correlations with in vitro or in vivo experiments (which is the main lacking element of the paper). \r\n\t3. Conclusions on the EMT lineage formation are presumptuous if the authors are only basing their results on 1 gene expression dataset and patient survival correlations. They also used a very small number of stromal gene markers. More significant stromal markers should be included in this analysis in addition to more cautious reporting of the EMT gene expression lineage formation. \r\n\t4.

Were the same samples used for the two experiments? This should be addressed or clarified. For example, for the gene ARF18 the results are strikingly different in Fig 3, Fig 6 and Table 2. This should be explained. Indeed, the relative level of expression found for this gene with RT-PCR is extraordinary big for a transcription factor.\r\n  - Some interesting results are not discussed. Though the paper is focused on ARF and Aux/IAA genes, the identification of other genes relevant for the process is not discussed, and I think that they should be at least outlined in the Discussion. Particularly for the NAC protein, mitogen-activated kinase and the ABC transporter.\r\n - At some points the Discussion lacks proper referencing. Examples can be found in Lines 330-335, 344-347 and 359-365. \r\n- Lines 203-208: Do all the embryos generated successfully develop into a seedling? \r\n - Discussion about ARF genes should be focused on the orthologs of the genes analyzed in this work, rather than a generalist discussion about ARFs.\r\n- Line 105: I think that the genomic resources are characterized rather than generated.\r\n- Lines 117-121: Do the species that are mentioned correspond to the references that follow?\r\n- Some Figure legends are too brief, it would be interesting if they included more information.\r\n- Why was the cyclophilin gene chosen as a reference gene for the RT-PCR experiments?\r\n- Lines 376-379: It should say that those expression data are for SE in Arabidopsis.\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is a very interesting work, but some English language editing is needed.

", "The study is both interesting and focused on the real changes of the rumen in the animals studied. However, the structure and presentation of the manuscript could be better if the authors improve several items.  \r\nTittle should emphasize characteristics of the study more than the techniques because it is not a paper describing a new methodology, it is a paper that describes microorganisms. It would be better to consider the species of the animal in the title, but in the paragraphs use the word yak. The phrase \u2018during different phenological periods in the montane grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau\u2019 of the line 10-11, it is adequate to be included in the title. \r\nAuthors did not select the best keywords for the study. For example, the word forage had to be considered. I suggest making a new selection of keywords. \r\nRegarding introduction, the authors did not describe in detail previous studies about the abundance of microorganisms in the rumen of yaks. Perhaps the information of the rumen of the animal living in the same zone could support the reason of the study. \r\nRegarding grammar, authors used capital letters after a comma, did not respect the space after a full-stop, the expression et al was not written in cursive. Sometimes they used verbs in present when they should be written in past. Authors should revise and correct the entire manuscript. \r\nLine 18 The most abundant phyla were, not are. \r\nLine 18- 19 The phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are mentioned twice. \r\nLine 20 The word respectively is not adequate in this context. Authors should mention all the percentages related to the phyla or re-write the sentence. \r\nLine 26-27 The ruminal microbial flora was, not is.\r\nLine 30 The word abundance would be better in this case, you use the word changes twice in the same statement.\r\nLine 42 It is not clear if this climate change is referred about differences in the weather, or in the process that is still in discussion if it is real o not. \r\nLine 46 Components of plants affect the nutritional state, and this situation affects animal growth.\r\nLine 49 Archaea do not produce volatile fatty acids, they use them to produce methane. Authors should consider the real role of the microorganisms in the rumen. \r\nLine 53-64 Authors should mention the microorganisms that have been detected in previous studies. \r\nLine 62 If there are not several studies of the microorganisms in rumen, authors should emphasize the use of high- throughput sequencing of their research. DNA pyrosequencing is related to the platform 454 of Roche. Currently, there are several platforms to sequence DNA of microbial communities. The word high- throughput sequencing is better to use in this case. \r\nLine 69 Define what is a short period of time would help to support the importance of to do a study for a long time. \r\nLine 70 Provide a short definition of phenological periods. \r\nLine 71 Delete the word therefore. \r\n\tWhy did the authors select only forage as food in the study? It is not clear if the animals can eat other different kinds of food. Authors mentioned the three stages of the forage: regreening, grass and withered grass. It would be better the use of abbreviations for these words in all the manuscript. In addition, the description of the information they would be to use the same order to describe the three stages. For example, first they could mention to regreening, then grass and the last withered. These suggestions to make easier to read the manuscript since in some paragraphs is a little difficult. If the authors possess photographs of the forage in the stages mentioned that could support the idea mentioned above. \r\nLine 88 Which was the role of thirty cattle?\r\nLine 94 To know the proportion (in percentage) of every species could be interesting for the discussion of the results. It will be adequate to consider if it has been described the components of the walls of the plants that constitute the forage and to find a relation with the results obtained in the prediction and the abundance of the microorganisms. \r\nLine 96- 101 Authors mentioned the sessions in the abstract, they should relate samples with them in this part of the methodology. \r\nLine 105 The stomach of ruminants possesses different zones. It would be interesting to know the zones that have been described in yaks and where samples were taken. It is not clear if the methodology to take samples was described previously or it was a procedure implemented in this study. \r\nLine 106 Begin the statement with the word twenty, not 20. \r\nLine 109 How many measurements did the authors do?\r\nLine 115 Mention the number of samples that were analysed. \r\nLine 117 If you analyse bacteria, you analyse prokaryotic no eukaryotic.\r\nLine 119 It is necessary to mention the reference of the primers. \r\nLine 124 It is necessary to mention the database used to do the taxonomic classification. \r\nLine 132 Add the title; statistical analyses. Authors presented Venn diagram, but they do not describe in the results the figure. \r\nThe tables present the term pooled-SEM or observed species that were not mentioned in the manuscript. \r\nAuthors did not present bar-charts of the relative abundance that would help to understand better the results. \r\nSome statistical analysis can compare physicochemical parameters and abundance of microorganisms, such as Canonical Correspondence Analysis, that were not considered and could give information of the most important components of the forage that had influence in the microorganisms. \r\nThe prediction of the metabolic function is adequate; however, I consider the focus in the abundance of microorganisms is most important because they are a real result, not a prediction. \r\nLine 138- 148 Authors mentioned the significant differences of the results; however, they did not compare the differences among the samples. For example; a presented 10% more protein than B. Authors should rewrite the paragraph and consider the differences detected among the samples. \r\nLine 146- 148 If authors know the percentage of each plant, they should incorporate the information into tables. \r\nLine 152 To describe in methodology what animals were selected. In methodology is only specified 10 yaks and another group that was not described in detail. \r\nLine 160 It is better to use the word gender in this case, not sex.\r\nLine 160-162 If the gender of animal presented differences, this would be part of the abstract.  \r\nLine 171 Why did the authors consider only the 15 most abundant species? Microbial communities always possess microorganisms in a low abundance as well as uncultivated microorganisms. It is adequate to mention them because they can possess a high activity and an important role in the degradation of the organic matter, even though they are not present in a high abundance or their function is not known. \r\nLine 185 It is better to write; of different genera, no sexes. \r\n\t   To relate genera with phyla could help to understand the taxonomic groups that present more changes. Families would also be associated to a phylum.  \r\nLine 253- 263 This paragraph would be in the introduction because it is the reason of the selection of specific times to take samples.\r\nLine 274 There are previous studies that describe pathways to degrade cellulose in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.  \r\nLine 294 Synergistetes is related to syntrophic associations with archaea to produce methane.in anaerobic environmental. \r\nLine 312 What is the meaning is sex x stage? "], "7406": ["I feel the manuscript lacks a bit of general introduction or discussion about the current knowledge on the roles and evolution of kinases in the plant kingdom. In particular, the evolutionary conservation of protein kinases in eukaryotes is not mentioned at all. For example, a quick search in PFAM database retrieved more than 600 Symbiodinium protein sequences with a potential kinase activity. Also, protein kinases are well described in multicellular plants (for example Arabidopsis thaliana has >1000 genes encoding kinases, see Wang et al., \u201cThe Protein Phosphatases and Protein Kinases of Arabidopsis thaliana\u201d, Arabidopsis book, 2007).\n\r\nI also found some typos in the manuscript:\r\n- line 60 \u201c\u2026 genus Symbiodinium, are photosynthetic\u2026\" I would remove the coma; \r\n- idem line 62 \u201cIn both, their\u2026\u201d; line 234: \u201c(gives)\u201d; \r\n- lines 302-303, I did not understand the following sentence \u201cUnfortunately, because anti-pTyr antibody-cross reactive proteins were inconsistently observed and due to the lack of reproducibility, were not considered.\" Major technical concern: No loading controls are provided in the figures. I strongly encourage the authors to provide images of nitrocellulose membranes stained with a general protein staining such as coomassie blue to show that equal amounts of proteins are present in the lanes analyzed by western blot. This is of particular importance for the experiments where modulation of the phosphorylations is induced experimentally. The presence of such loading controls would greatly improve the reader\u2019s level of confidence in the experiments.\n\r\nMinor technical concern: the authors are using a NBT/BCIP revelation technique for the revelation step of the western blots. This technique is based on the activity of an alkaline phosphatase and I am questioning the effect of this phosphatase on nitrocellulose immobilized phosphorylated proteins. In this study, Castillo-Medina and colleagues have used an interesting approach to reveal the presence of serine-, threonine- and proline-phosphorylated proteins in extracts from different Symbiodinium species subjected to various experimental conditions. A strong limitation of the technique lies in the fact that there is no possibility to directly identify the phosphorylated proteins or the kinases responsible of the phosphorylation. Nevertheless, this work allowed the authors to reveal the presence of Ser, Tyr and Thr phosphorylation in their Symbiodinium samples. They also revealed phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events in response to light stimuli. Despite the aforementioned limitations, this piece of work is interesting per se, especilly if we consider the very little amount of data already published in the field. To my sense, this work meets Peer J standards and should be published after completion of the minor revisions listed herein. ", "The authors Castilla-Medina et al. have presented a profile of phosphorylated proteins from three species of the Symbiodinium family and specifically the light induced phosphorylation and rephosphorylation switch of a 75 kDa proteins from S. microadriaticum. The study is essential as it aimed at filling the knowledge gap about the key signal transduction proteins that undergo the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation switch in response to environmental stimuli like light conditions, nutrient content and availability, etc. The manuscript is easy to understand with clear English language and proper use of grammar and is structured as per PeerJ standards. The authors have reviewed relevant and adequate background information to set a context to the research question being addressed. The reviewer thanks the authors for providing the necessary raw data corroborating their results. Though the authors have well-defined the research question and provided relevant data to corroborate their findings, the results are preliminary and require further corroboration with orthologous methods. The reviewer has following concerns about the data reported and suggestions to further improve the manuscript \u2013 \r\n1.\tThe authors have stated the detailed protocol for cell lysate preparation and isolation of supernatant for protein analysis, however, protease and phosphatase inhibitors were not used during lysate preparation. It is critical to use a concoction of these inhibitors, especially, phosphatase inhibitors as Espina, V. et al (Molecular & cellular proteomics, 7(10), 1998-2018) reported an augmentation of phosphorylation after phosphatase inhibitor use.\r\n2.\tThe study uses polyclonal anti-pThr and anti-pSer antibodies whereas monoclonal anti-pTyr. The authors should provide an explanation for the same. \r\n3.\tThe western blot procedure uses PBST, however, phosphates in the PBST buffer can potentially interfere and therefore it is recommended to use TBST instead of PBST\r\n4.\tThe authors should consider presenting the total protein content of the lysate as control. \r\n5.\tThe intensity of the bands indicated for phosphorylated proteins in figure 1 are very weak and barely visible. Perhaps, the authors can try lower dilutions of the primary and/or secondary antibodies, longer incubations times or temperature etc. to increase the intensity of the bands. However, if the authors have already tried different ways to improve the band intensity, they should mention in the results section. \r\n6.\tTo further support their western blot findings about the effect of light on dephosphorylation & rephosphorylation of pp75 protein in S. KB8, the authors should consider estimating the band intensities in figures 2 and 3 using densitometry analysis on three separate assays to estimate the statistical significance of this phenomenon.\r\n7.\tThough the western blot is partially convincing, the authors should definitely consider using orthologous methods like mass spectrometry to corroborate their findings. Mass spectrometry is highly sensitive and is considered a gold standard method for studying phosphorylated proteins and other post-translational modifications (Mann, M. et al. (2002) Trends Biotechnol. 20:261). The above-mentioned suggestions will strengthen the manuscript and will serve to fill a critical knowledge gap as mentioned by the authors. Though the findings are interesting, the work is still preliminary and needs further improvement before it can be accepted for publication. The reviewer strongly advocates use of orthologous method to corroborate the findings as, in general, there are some concerns with the specificity and cross-reactivity of phospho-antibodies. ", "The results presented were very limited and immature for publishing.\n\r\nPlease also see my comments below. This manuscript falls within the scope of PeerJ, but the research question was vaguely defined. The hypothesis, approaches, and results were not justified.\n\r\nThe authors identified the gap as \u2018\u2026very little information from the genus Symbiodinium regarding proteins that participate in key phosphorylation processes for signal-transduction events that arise from environmental stimuli\u2019. They sought to identify phosphorylated proteins, but showed only western blots, without actually identifying anything.\n\r\nWhy didn\u2019t the author use the mass spec to identify the proteins? The author should at least report which genes/proteins are the phosphorylated proteins. Otherwise, this piece of research will not benefit anyone in the field or those who are interested in Symbiodinium biology. \n\r\nThe genome of Symbiodinium kawagutii was assembled and annotated in 2015 (Lin S. et al, Science). The authors should try to identify the protein of interest using this data. Are there homologous proteins to other known light-induced signaling proteins? It is unclear how many times these western blots have been performed.\n\r\n \u2018The intensity of band\u2019 was not properly quantified and no meaningful replications was reported. Looking at fig2,3, S1, and S2, I can\u2019t reach the same conclusion as the authors.\n\r\nThe reported changes in fig2 & fig3 are not validated. This change in phosphorylated protein level could result from a change in total protein level. If that is the case, then this process is not related to phosphorylation at all.\n\r\nNone of the results were validated by other methods. I am not convinced. The authors can\u2019t even claim that they have been observing the same protein. Assume there are two proteins, both run at 75kD in a gel, one is upregulated and one is down-regulated, the method here won\u2019t be able to distinguish them.\n\r\nThe conclusions are not well supported by the results.

For example, dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase is the corresponding enzyme of CYP2E1. Please see the following citations (PLoS One. 2016 Nov 1;11(11):e0165667; J Helminthol. 2002 Mar;76(1):71-8.; Curr Drug Metab. 2000 Sep;1(2):107-32. Review.)\r\n5-\tAuthors mentioned in page 14 lined 186\u201dThe expression of CYP-1 family is shown in Figure 1\u201d and should be corrected into CYP 1A2 since family 1 contains several of CYP isozymes.\r\n6-\tAuthors mentioned in page 14 \u201cCyp2a1 increased dramatically after birth, reached 250-fold at 200 weanling (21 day), and peaked on 35 days of age (1100 fold). It was gradually declined afterwards.\u201d. This is not true since no change in CYP 2a1 after day 28 until 800 d. \r\n7-\tWhy authors did not study the gene and the protein expression for the same isozyme. They did RTPCR for 1A1 and Western blotting for another isozyme, Cyp2a1. It was very important to perform both expressions for the same CYP since both expressions could confirm each other.\r\n8-\tMy comment No.7 is also the same for figures 2,3 and 4.\r\n9-\tIn page 27, description of CYP 2 family is the same of figure 2 legend.

In general, the results give more questions than answers and I would like to explain and discuss that with the next points. In general, I m lacking to see dose-response curve like effects between the 50, 200 and 800 mg/kgBW groups for the various measured endpoints. It looks a little bit like that for the highest dose effects are different compared to the other two groups (downturn effect at too high doses). Dose-response effects have not been proper identified in the manuscript or discussed: The authors have not performed any form of trend test or dose-response models to confirm their conclusions (just ANOVA plus posthoc which tests nominal differences and not ordinal trends). This makes many of the conclusion\u2019s speculations. \r\n3.1.1 The interpretation of figure one is already very difficult. \r\nIn the group without ER receptor antagonist the weight gain is obviously the smallest in the lowest concentration groups comparable to EE, however, it increases dose dependent and is absent in the highest dose group compared to negative controls. Which gives the impression the effect decreases with the concentration of AEAA. \r\nIn the group with ER antagonist the weight gain is seemingly dose dependent decreasing compared to negative control. It looks like there is a positive synergy between AEAA and the ER antagonist.\r\n3.1.2 Figure 2 and 3: The authors claim that \u201c\u2026 the AEAA demonstrated an increase in the level of estrogen and a severe reduction in the progesterone in a dose-dependent manner.\u201d (line 236f as well in the abstract). However, I can not see a dose dependent increase or decrease of any of the two in the group without ER receptor antagonist. \r\n3.1.3 The authors implicitly claim that the phytochemicals they have identified are responsible for the effects they have observed. However, also other pharmacological interactions are possible and not discussed, mentioned or tested for. E.g. high doses of St John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum) induces CYP3A4 which is also responsible for the metabolization of several hormones and can lower the effectiveness of e.g. hormonal contraception therapies. The authors have not supported their speculative conclusions by additional experiments (e.g. repeating experiments with the identified pure phytochemicals.\r\n3.2 For GC/MS how the metabolites are identified is unclear. Has the main fragment m/z just been confirmed to a reference spectrum from the literature or has the entire fragments spectra been compared to pure reference substances spiked in AEAA or pure? Some more explanations are needed here. ", "Overall, the article is well written, provides sufficient background information, figures and literature. However, the manuscript needs some editing. Throughout the manuscript spaces are missing between some words (see lines 20, 48, 62, 117,119, 131, 189, 280, 335, 339). Also in the literature section there should be either a free line or no free line between all the references. All references should be also numbered as cited in the manuscript.

This would also improve the introduction.\r\nAnother example of where the language could be improved is found in lines 62-65. It is unclear what is being said. Is the intent to introduce the uterotrophic assay with something along the lines of \u201cA model used to evaluate the effect of chemicals on estrogen receptors is the uterotrophic assay in which removal of the ovaries reduces endogenous estrogens, causing the uterus to shrink. Replacement of these hormones with external sources of estrogen causes a trophic response of the uterus. \u201d\r\nPlease correct the references. Citations in-line are numbered, but the reference section appears to be sorted alphabetically, making it difficult to determine whether the citations used are appropriate. The experimental design is generally well reported, but there are some areas where the rationale for the design and the components used could be clarified. For example in line 103, the immature rat version of the uterotrophic assay was developed because immature rats already have a uterus that is highly responsive to exogenous estrogens. Why where the immature rats used for this study also ovariectomized? Another example from line 103 includes the diet, which ought to be specified, and a statement made about whether the diet is low in phytoestrogens or phytoestrogen-free, as diet has been identified in the OECD test guideline for uterotrophic assays as a potential confound in uterotrophic studies. \r\nIn line 107, please indicate why the extract was injected twice daily. Was there a concern that some of the polyphenols might have a short half life? Also please clarify whether 800 mg/kgBW was injected twice per day for a total dose of 1600 mg/kgBW/day, or 400 mg/kgBW was injected twice per day for a total dose of 800 mg/kgBW/day.\r\nIn all of the supplemental tables, please use color consistently. For example, both of the graphs in the BW WO and BW WA tabs use blue columns, then in the BW combined tab, BW WA is colored orange. Please make the columns in all of the WA tabs orange as well, to facilitate comparisons. It would also be helpful if the axes were consistent for all graphs for the same endpoint. For example, the Y axis for ER WO runs to 125, ER WA to 100, and ER combined to 140. This makes it difficult to compare the magnitude of response between the graphs.\r\nIn the supplemental tables, for the weight reports, please check that the correct values have been graphed and in the correct order. In the BW WO tab, the 50 mg/kg body weights are near controls, then there is a decrease at 200 mg/kg. In Figure A in the BW combined, the 50 mg/kg body weights are very low, then increase dose-dependently until at 800 mg/kg, the weights are close to controls. \r\nOn the BW Combined Figure A, please also indicate what ## refers to. Is it statistically significant compared to controls pre-treated with antagonist?\r\nIn the supplemental tables on the ER combined page, there are two version of the same graph, which reports estrogen levels for rats with and without antagonist pre-treatment. Please remove one graph. Please also remove the extraneous ##, **, and * in columns A and B.\n\r\nIn the Prg combined tab, please remove the extraneous ## and # in columns O-R.\r\nPlease be consistent about indicating statistical significance within this supplemental data. The progesterone WO is indicated in the graphs in the combined tab as being statistically significant for all treatments, but the graph in the PRG WO tab does not indicate any statistically significant effects.

As only a few similar proteins have been studied in other mollusks species, results contribute to gain original knowledge about the mechanisms that mollusk have developed to maintain their integrity and survive. Some major and minor aspects were found to improve the manuscript before it can be accepted for publication. ", "This paper deals with characterization of N66 isolated from the shell of P.mazatlanica and also its recombinant protein expressed in E.coli.  \r\n  Many shell matrix proteins have been isolated from nacreous layer of bivalve and N66 is one of them. So, it is not much interesting if papers are merely devoted to similar results reported before. Although the reviewer could not understand well this paper due to poor English writing, it seems that this paper does not provide any new findings compared with those reported previously. \r\n  Furthermore, there are some mysterious results for examples as described below.\r\n1)\tSDS-PAGE analyses show intensities of protein bands not dependent on concentrations of various fractions obtained by chromatography (Fig, S2 and S3). This raises the possibility that these are proteins contaminated during purification process.\r\n2)\tRecombinant protein from E.coli repression system should give only one protein without any isoforms because this system give no post-translation modification. However, this paper gives two protein bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig.3).\r\n3)\tNo spectral data for LC/MS are given in this paper, which doubts any guarantee for N66 obtained in this paper.\r\n4)\tOther ambiguities are also found in cDNA cloning, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. ", "It is well known that post-translational modification plays a very important role during the protein interactions, as well as in the process of biomineralization. The author mentioned that a higher carbonic anhydrase and crystallization ability has been observed in in vitro prokaryotic expression of the recombinant N66, rather than the natural N66 extracted from oyster shell, indicating that the modification of the N66 protein might inhibit its own functions. Although, it\u2018s meaningful for us to understand how matrix proteins regulate shell formation, the overall conclusion is not well supported by the authors\u2019 experimental findings. The experiments can be further improved. The experiments can be further improved.\r\na. Compare carbonic anhydrase and crystallization ability of recombinant N66 with native one, after in vitro glycosylation. And also compare both activitis of the native N66 with recombinant one, after de-glycosylation.\r\nb. Does Native N66 have other post-translational modifications? If so, can it also affect carbonic anhydrase and crystallization ability of N66? The conclusion is not accurate.\r\nThe author made a conclusion that the lack of posttranslational modifications in the recombinant N66 modulates its activity via simply comparing the carbonic anhydrase and crystallization ability of natural N66 with recombinant N66. However, protein post-translational modifications are not only glycosylation modifications, but also other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation.

"], "6713": ["In this manuscript, the investigators evaluate whether hypusination, a post-translational protein modification, is essential in P. falciparum malaria parasites. Using a glmS riboswitch, the investigators reduce expression of PfDHS, an enzyme required for hypusination. Immunoblot analysis indicates a significant reduction in PfDHS-GFP levels, although protein is still present. Hypusination levels are modestly but reproducibly decreased to 30% of untreated levels (Fig. 3), even with maximum reduction of PfDHS-GFP protein levels. With maximum reduction of PfDHS-GFP protein level, parasite morphology remains grossly normal. Using a competitive growth assay and comparing relative parasite levels by qPCR, the investigators conclude that reduced DHS protein levels cause a modest, albeit significant, reduction in asexual parasite replication. Overall, this is a clearly written manuscript that provides initial evidence on the biological function of a possibly essential gene in malaria parasites. In general, replicates are well described and adequate, and analyses are transparent and statistically rigorous. There are a number of minor concerns noted. Specifically, several conclusions are more strongly stated than is warranted by the data presented.  In addition, because the growth defect is so modest and the data presented has larger-than-expected biological variability, additional data should be provided in support, as noted below. Specific comments are noted below: 1) Fig 4a. I understand why the investigators chose to use growth competition given the modest effect on parasite growth by reduced DHS. However, the data presented in Fig 4A is not quite convincing. The biological variability of the 5 mM GlcN samples (see t=6 in particular) is wide, and substantially larger variability is seen for this strain than, for example, DHFR (Fig 4C). I would prefer to see the data in terms of % parasitemia. The investigators suggest that this method is preferred over correcting for dilution factors, but it would be preferable to present those data side-by-side for direct comparison. \n\r\n2) In addition, I suggest softening the language, as the data presented is promising but not sufficiently definitive to conclude that \u201cPfDHS gene is essential\u201d (line 548). Certainly, PfDHS is not a highly promising drug target, if >5-fold reduction in activity leads to only a modest growth defect after multiple cycles of asexual growth.\n\r\n3) The investigators should also soften the language linking the phenotypic effects of reduced DHS levels to reduced hypusination. Many metabolic enzymes have \u201cmoonlighting\u201d functions that do not depend on their catalytic activity, and therefore the cellular function of DHS may be broader than just hypusination. A better control would be integration of a \u201ccatalytically dead\u201d version of this protein, so that enzymatic activity and hypusination could be distinguished from any other cellular roles. \n\r\n4) The investigators should soften the language with respect to GC7. Specifically, the data presented does not definitively confirm the in vivo target of GC7 (line 522-523). Although this compound appears to inhibit DHS in vitro, it is not clear that its antiparasitic effects are mediated exclusively through DHS. Since \u201coff target\u201d effects are possible (even likely at high concentrations), sensitivity to this compound is suggestive but far from definitive. As noted above, conclusions are somewhat overstated and alternative explanations for findings have not been discussed. ", "The paper is clearly written for a general audience, provides adequate context and motivation for the work done, and includes legible and informative figures/tables to support the manuscript text. The central research questions related to whether dehydrohypusine in Plasmodium plays an essential role and its potential as an antimalarial drug target are clearly stated. Appropriate experiments explained in sufficient detail to allow repeating are carried out with adequate rigor. Prior work on this gene in Plasmodium has been published, but direct information on its likely essentiality had not been reported until this manuscript. Experimental data is accompanied by appropriate controls--e.g. use the functional glmS ribozyme for controlling gene expression is paired with a control using an inactive version of this ribozyme, and these are used together throughout the manuscript. Overall, the manuscript is clearly written and provides useful additional findings to the existing literature. \n\r\nTwo minor points to address are:\n\r\n1) In the Results and again the Discussion sections (e.g lines 446-452 ), the authors attempt to justify why the PfDHS enzyme is more likely essential based on the frequency of proteins with poly-Pro motifs in various proteins (including non-essential genes. This could be true. At the same time, though, if only one essential poly-Pro-containing protein were dependent on DHS function this enzyme would also be essential. Thus, a more balanced (though not necessarily exhaustive) discussion exploring why PfDHS function could be essential should be considered.\n\r\n2) Lines 527-528. The statement \u201cLow EC50 rations is consistent with off-targeting\u201d is not always true and should be revised for improved accuracy. An alternative explanation, for example, could be that target protein expression levels after knockdown relative to what is needed for parasite survival is modest, and similar compound concentrations are required to abrogate function of the target protein ", "Line 381: It is not clear what is the puromycilation signal. I suggest to add one sentence for explanation.\n\r\nLine 532-535: The sentence \"this number is markedly fewer than in yeast (Li et al., 2014) and other lower eukaryotes (Mandal, Mandal & Park, 2014).\" is ambiguous. Provide the number of essential proteins containing polyproline motifs per total protein numbers or its percentage in yeast and other lower eukaryotes clearly so that readers are able to compare. Also are they significantly different between Plasmodium and others?\n\r\nTo discuss if the parasite molecule is a potential target of drug development, structural difference between parasite and human molecules would provide important insights. This pathway is well-conserved among eukaryotes, so discuss the feasibility of DHS as a drug target based on the structural dissimilarity or similarity in the discussion section.\n\r\nI strongly recommend authors to supply legends for supplementary figures. Currently nothing is provided. Some are impossible to understand without the legend. Line 381 and Fig S1C: Fig. S1C is not really sufficient to show the expected integration of the plasmid into the target gene locus. Southern blot analysis is required to show the integration to the DHS gene locus (glmS and M9) as was done for PfFC gene locus in supplementary Fig. S2. I guess the pattern of the lane 3 on the Southern blot in Fig S2 indicates disrupted gene locus and existence of the remaining episomal plasmid. Remaining plasmid could produce false positive by PCR.\n\r\nLine 408. What is the effect of GlcN against the FC expression in PfFC_glmS parasite line? Why Western blot was not performed? Is it possible that the gene locus was disrupted and FC was not expressed anymore? If that is the case, 3D7 strain would serve as a control and I cannot see the rationality to use PfFC_glmS as a control. Comments?\n\r\nIn the conclusions, authors clearly state \"Loss of PfDHS function leads to reduction of eIF5A hypusination,..\". However, the claim that < 20-kDa band stained with anti-hypusine antibody was eIF5A was solely speculated based on the band size. Immunoprecipitation with anti-hypusine antibody and staining with anti-eIF5A antibody or mass-spec analysis with proper controls is suggested. Otherwise lower the tone. Having a look at Fig. S6, I have a concern that authors might not clearly define the parasite stages; ring, trophozoite, and schizont. For example, \"trophozoite\"s indicated in A and C are actually schizonts as they have multiple nuclei. Also \"ring\" indicated in B is a trophozoite as this clearly contains hemozoin. This misclassification likely reflect analysis based on the stages, I suggest authors re-examine all images, re-classify the parasites for re-analysis. Line 538-544 I feel there is a gap in the following argument: \"P. falciparum also possesses a number of non-essential polyproline-motif proteins, including notably the erythrocyte membrane protein 1 family, which plays important roles in virulence (Deitsch & Hviid, 2004). Interestingly, polyproline motifs are also abundant in the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) protein family of the African sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Translation of VSG proteins is sensitive to eIF5A levels (Nguyen et al., 2015), possibly pointing to a similar mechanism for controlling expression of virulence factors among these highly diverged human parasites.\". Polyproline residues may have structural function such as forming polyproline helices, which may be important for the protein-protein interaction, as a linker between domains in newly generated species-specific proteins, and so on. Any evidences suggest T. brucei use hypusinated eIF5 to control VSG expression? Do authors suggest involvement of eIF5 of T. brucei and P. falciparum in the antigenic variation? Unless authors provide more robust data or more comprehensive bioinformatics analysis including other eukaryotic pathogens, I would suggest to remove these sentences. "], "6691": [".

Figure 8 shows the relationship among different LOX gene based on the sequence of catalytic domain and it does not show the wat of gene transfer as the authors claimed on lines 232-235 ", "The manuscript by Pestov et al investigates the properties of the lysyl oxidase form present in the archaeon Haloterrigena turkmenica. While the validity of the findings and experimental design is discussed in the following sections, different aspects referring to the reporting of the manuscript are evaluated here. First, in general, the language used throughout the text is acceptable and structure of the manuscript conforms the journal standard. With respect to whether introduction properly shows the background of the field, there is a particular sentence that does not actually reflect what it is already known on phylogeny of LOX enzymes. Thus, in line 56 it is said that \u201cmost fungi are unknown to possess (LOX)\u201d, whereas Grau-Bove et al, 2015 in a very comprehensive analysis of LOX isoforms in a wide variety of organisms already described the presence of homologues of this enzyme in some fungi. Regarding the figures, it is counter-intuitive to see plots composed by a group of dispersed points. My suggestion is to make bargraphs where a non-numerical x axis is displayed (Figure 2C), and line graphs in those cases representing a numerical axis (Figure 2A, B, D and Figure 3). Additionally, in the alignment shown in Figure 5, it is also difficult to see how the different deletion LOX constructs of H. turkmenica were designed and whether this makes sense in the context of the mouse sequence. Finally, information about the sequences used in the alignment shown in Figure 8 is not provided, nor the details of the method employed to generate it. Original research in the manuscript is within the scope of the journal. Research question is in fact not clear: whether the authors want to analyze the properties of the H. turkmenica form or they want to have a look to the phylogeny of the LOX homologues. The former can be in fact interesting in the context of the mammalian forms, the latter has been already done in detail in the article by Grau-Bove et al, 2015.\r\nWith respect of the technical standard of the investigation, as discussed in the next section, protein characterization methodologies are of poor quality. Methods do not include any information about how alignments were done (insufficient description in the figure legend). With respect to the findings, the authors claim that they were able to express, purify and refold a couple of deletion mutants of LOX from H. turkmenica, whereas Fig. 1 only shows the expression of one of them. To be more illustrative with the differences between these proteins and the mammalian homologues, optimization of refolding of these protein forms (Figure 2 only for one construct) should be compared with the mammalian homologue. This will answer the question of whether mouse or human LOXs present the same difficulties for purification, refolding and if they are equivalent in terms of activity. In any case, there is no information about the robustness of the data, whether they are replicates from different preparations, no statistical approach seems to be used.\r\nThe authors claim that they are generated a polyclonal antibody against the H. turkmenica protein and used it to characterize the expression of this form in these cells. In fact, quality of the blot is poor, and it is difficult to believe that the faint band observed at about 50 kDa can actually correspond to the endogenous LOX homologue, and therefore, it is very speculative to say that this can be a precursor form. Even more unrealistic is the statement that the growth of the cells without yeast extract resulted in the formation of a band of 3 kDa less mobility.\r\nFinally, to my opinion, multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis is also very poor, particularly considering the complete study performed in Grau-Bove et al, 2015.

The manuscript is well written albeit a minor fixing and would be easily assessable to the international audience. The authors did a commendable job in introducing the wide spread usage of  Microalgae citing literature and the different uses of PTP.  Figures are relevant but lack labeling, legend and description.  (See my comments for the author) The research is original and clarifies the aims and studies the role of Polysacs from PTP. The methods section seems to be incomplete and lacks a lot of material for instance MTT assay, cell numbers used for the experiment, time points assessed which would make replication impossible.  (See my comments for the author).  The most important issue I have here is the missing time-course of the effect of the drug.  (See my comments for the author).  I also have the question as to why only 1 cell line was tested for drug efficacy (HCC).  It would be nice if the authors can replicate the same results in another cancer type. The data is robust and proper statistical methods were used. The conclusions for the most part are well stated. The manuscript is well written and is easy to follow. It has a concise methodology and results are well presented and adhere to the standards of Peer J. However, there are some issues that need to be clarified, a few experiments performed before acceptance. Please see my comments below:-\r\nMethods and Experimental Design:-\n\r\n 1] I would suggest the authors perform a time course experiment to determine for the efficacy of PTP.  (Day 0, Day 1,3 and 5) along with the PTP concentrations mentioned here. Also, it would be good if you show how PTP compares to No treatment overtime and see the uninhibited growth rate of HepG2 without any perturbation. Methods section does not even mention about the MTT assay at all, I strongly suggest the authors add a description about the MTT assay. I would also suggest the authors describe all the information like number of cells used, time points assessed and analyzed.\n\r\n2] Why was HepG2 chosen as the model cell line for the manuscript? I would strongly suggest that the authors repeat these experiments with different cell lines of different cancer types and show that PTP indeed has anticancer activity and is not limited to HepG2.  Again a time course study would be welcomed here. I would also suggest toning down the claim of anticancer activity based on the current findings from 1 cell line or be specific about HepG2 or Hepatocellular carcinoma if we can reproduce this effect in other HCC cell lines. \n\r\nResults:-\r\n1] Titles for results can be made more relevant so as to give the  gist of the result which can be expanded upon in the description. For instance, \u201cPTP inhibits HepG2 growth invivo\u201d. \n\r\n2] Line 147 to 150 is confusing and contradicting. The current phrasing makes it difficult to comprehend and is convulative.  I suggest stating your findings in a more succinct manner.\n\r\n3] I would suggest the authors expand upon the findings in the Section 3.3 \u201cCell Cycle Analysis\u201d instead of statements like from the result we deduced\u2026. (line 162 -172). In the current format, the authors leave the interpretation to the readers. \n\r\nFigures:-\r\n1] All the figures lack a description.

", "Language of the manuscript lacks clarity, at points it creates ambiguity bordering with nonsense and some phrasing is odd. To give a few examples: Line 46: The sentence \u201cHowever, blood supply\u2026\u201d lacks a subject and it is not clear what \u201c..will cause additional damage to the heart.\u201d Similarly on line 80: \u201c\u2026TAX involved in the amelioration of cardiac disorders associated with against hypertrophy\u2026\u201d the sentence is incomplete. What is the associated condition and why does it go against hypertrophy? Line 93: \u201c\u2026fed common feedstuff and drank tap water freely \u2026\u201d. What the authors meant is probably feeding the rats with common lab chow and allowing the animals to drink water ad libitum. Certainly using the word \u201cwhittled\u201d (line 315) in association with the effect of TAX on apoptosis is very odd. Not only needs the manuscript re-writing, it needs thorough editing by a native speaker. There are too many lines affected by language errors to list.\r\nSetting the language problems aside, the intro provides sufficient background for the study. Although it is not clear, why post-conditioning was used. This is not explained anywhere in the manuscript. Therefore the reader is left wondering why this approach was selected.\r\nOverall structure of the manuscript conforms to standards within the field.\r\nFigures are relevant and of acceptable quality. Labelling is fine, figure legends give redundant information in that they describe what is already apparent from the figure itself.\r\nRaw data are supplied. The manuscript describes primary original research.\r\nDue to language problems the research question is not explicit besides testing what could be the effect on ischemia/reperfusion damage.\r\nThere are several important questions regarding the experimental design and how was the research conducted. Why were the two concentrations of TAX selected? How was the medium containing TAX prepared? Was TAX dissolved in aqueous media directly? If not and stock solution of TAX dissolved in another solvent was used did the controls contain the solvent? Why was post-conditioning used? If selection criteria were applied for the isolated hearts what was the fail rate, i.e. how many hearts failed to meet the criteria, if eight animals were selected per experimental group? At what time point were collected tissue samples that were used for enzyme activity test and immunoblotting? There is no mention of performing subcellular fractionation. Were the proteins, cytochrome c in particular, tested for in total cell lysate? The kits indicated in Materials and Methods generate protein level data in pg/ml, but the corresponding figure gives ng/mg protein. What was the conversion used? The data in Figure 1 show no error bars and do not indicate whether the points shown are mean or median. What was the standard deviation for data shown in Figure 1? \r\nThere is no sufficient detail of Methods to allow replication. It is not clear from the manuscript whether the data are robust. That should be made clear in several instances (Methods, Results, Figure legends). The only mention is that there were eight animals per experimental group. Does it mean that each and every heart was subjected to the ischemia protocol, histopathological examination, antioxidant enzymes activity and protein expression? It is possible, however, it is not clearly stated. In any case, the number of samples in each tested group should be given.\r\nConclusions are based on the data presented and are stated well within the limits of the language used. Lot of the questions were put forth above. The idea is not irrelevant, however, the manuscript overall is poorly written with insufficient detail given.\r\nFor better clarity the main concerns (questions) are repeated here.\r\n1.

", "In this manuscript, Tang Z et al., aim to demonstrate a function for Taxifolin in protecting against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Overall, the manuscript is well structured, and provides sufficient evidence to suggest a potential role for Taxifolin in this process. A few minor revisions could help strengthen the quality of the manuscript:\n\r\n- The legend to figure 1 is missing. A few sentences describing the protocol would be helpful\n\r\n- The graph in figure 5B is titled MAD, when it\u2019s likely meant to be MDA\n\r\n- There are several instances of grammatically incorrect sentences. For example, line 57 (\u2018in the I/R injury\u201d, \u201ccardiomyoctes were observed\u201d), line 81 (\u201cquercetin potentially beneficial\u201d), line 84 (\u201cin present study\u201d), line 226 (\u201cfew cells dissolve and degeneration\u201d), line 247 (\u201cmay protect mitochondria attenuate apoptosis\u201d), line 252 (\u201cproteins expressions\u201d) , etc.  These are not exhaustive, and significantly affect the readability of the manuscript. Perhaps having the text reviewed by a native English speaker would help. In figure 6, the authors aim to measure the expression of several apoptosis-related proteins. A few concerns regarding this experiment:\r\n- It is unclear from reading the materials section if the commercially available kits used in this experiment are directly measuring protein level (through an ELISA-type method) or if a western-blotting type quantification is used. The authors should clarify the precise method used here\r\n- In panel 6A, the authors claim to be specifically measuring levels of cytosolic-Cytochrome C. However, it is unclear if a specific nuclear-cytosolic fractionation of cell lysate was employed. If so, measuring levels of control proteins that are found only in the cytosol or nucleus will provide confidence in the integrity of the fractionation method Overall, I believe the data presented in this manuscript support the conclusions made by the authors. One point to note however is that I/R-associated injury has been well documented to involve multiple forms of cell death including apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis. It appears that Taxifolin mediates its protective effect through apoptosis. But the role of other forms of cell death cannot be discounted. The authors should consider adding a brief speculative discussion addressing this point.

Y et al. compare the bioactivities of organic extracts of wild and cultivated P. ferulae edible mushroom. This manuscript builds on earlier evidence that P. ferulae extracts possess antioxidant and antitumor properties (Alam N et al 2012, Wang W et al 2014, Choi DB et al 2004). In particular, they analyze the polysaccharide, polyphenol, and flavonoid composition in P. ferulae ethanol extracts and in the petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol sub-fractions of the ethanol extracts. Furthermore, the authors measure the antioxidant potential of the extracts using DPPH scavenging and reducing power assays. Ethanol extracts and sub-fractions of wild and cultivated P. ferulae display a dose-dependent increase in antioxidant activity. The extracts are then tested for antitumor activity on mouse and human tumor cell lines. Higher concentrations of wild P. ferulae extracts show more dramatic effect on cell viability than cultivated P. ferulae extracts, particularly in Eca-109 and HeLa cells. The authors provide evidence that P. ferulae extracts potentiate the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor cells that triggers cell death.\n\r\nSome noteworthy aspects of the study:\r\n1.\tUse of Cisplatin and DMSO as controls in cell viability experiments.\r\n2.\tDetailed descriptions of experimental methods.\r\n3.\tAnalysis of apoptotic and necrotic cell populations in treated cells.\r\n4.\tGC-MS analysis to determine chemical composition of petroleum ether sub-fractions of wild and cultivated P. ferulae ethanol extracts.

It is not clear whether these solvents were also evaporated prior to reconstitution in DMSO. In addition, line 74 should mention that the extracts were dissolved in 100 percent DMSO. \r\n        a.\tIf the solvents petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol were not evaporated, then it must be shown either by experimental evidence or literature citation whether these solvents have any effect on DPPH scavenging, reducing power, and cell viability. \n\r\n2.\tIn the Results section, Polysaccharide, polyphenol and flavonoid contents of PFEE-W and -C and subfractions, the authors state on line 171 \u201cPolysaccharide content in Pe-W is lower than that in Pe-C and Ea-W and Ba-W are similar with Ea-C and Ba-C, respectively.\u201d \n\r\nThe polysaccharide content in Pe-W is lowest compared to all other sub-fractions. The statement is not clear and does not correlate with the numbers on Table 1. \n\r\n3.\tIn Figure 1, DPPH scavenging and reducing power assays, there is no reference positive control (a known compound with antioxidant properties). It is hard to assess the importance of these results in the absence of a reference. The authors must either provide experimental data using a reference positive control or draw comparison to other compounds that have antioxidant properties in the Discussion section. \n\r\n4.\tThe authors analyze the differences in fatty acid content of petroleum ether sub-fractions of wild and cultivated P. ferulae using GC-MS and claim that the differences in the constituents may cause different antitumor activities. The authors need to explain this further in the Discussion citing studies that show antitumor activity of compounds containing various fatty acids.\n\r\n5.\tIn Figure 4A, the authors show data that Ea-W and Ea-C sub-fractions can induce ROS production in HeLa cells. The control used in these experiments is 0.4% DMSO. DMSO itself appears to induce ROS production at 8h, 12h, and 24 timepoints. The authors must add untreated cells as an additional control to show the baseline level of ROS at these timepoints.

"], "6082": ["The article compares arranged equations with classical equations of enzyme kinetics. It is not clear what is compared: sometimes the author mentions an arrangement of equations and in other cases he mentions a partial inhibition mechanism. If the problem is the mechanism, he should mention that a equation deduced from a partial inhibition mechanism will sure be better describing the partial inhibition and better when fitting to experimental data where the system is affected by partial inhibition. If this is not the case, it is hard to understand how a arranged equation will fit better than the original. Maybe the author is proposing a new fitting method, however, it was not explicitly mentioned. There is no description of the experimental design, methods and analysis of the data. The main conclusion was that the modifier equation was able to model in good agreement the experimental data. How obvious is that an arranged equation will fit as well as the original equation? I think that we have two options:\r\ni) The arranged equations are as good as the original equations when used as mathematical models. Unless the author is proposing a new fitting method (which is not explicitly mentioned), the article lacks scientific merit.\r\nii) The author did not properly nor clearly described the objective of this work to ensure the correct understanding when reading the manuscript.\r\n In addition, as the methods were not described it is difficult to evaluate the quality of the results. The main objective of the article was not clearly exposed. What the author intend to do? What intend to demonstrate? What is the improvement when using the arranged equations?\r\nThe methodology was not described. The methods used to test the ability of the arranged equations to fit experimental data were not described. In the same way, the methods to compare the fitting quality were not described. Indeed, there are a lot of information, calculations and calculation methods implicit in the results that were not described. Surely, a significant improvement of the manuscript is possible adding this information. As an example, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was calculated and used to evaluate the data. It is necessary to describe the calculation and usefulness of the BIC in the data evaluation process.\r\nIt is necessary to add all this vital information to improve tha manuscript.\n\r\nSome comments:\r\n1. The author continuously define enzymatic activity as Vmax. This definition is wrong because the enzymatic activity is obtained from an experimental assay in standard conditions which result is not necessarily the Vmax. Indeed, the Vmax can be related to the enzymatic activity, however, the enzymatic activity cannot be related to Vmax. Just in the case that the substrate concentration is saturated (S0 >> Km), the obtained reaction rate will be approximately the Vmax.\n\r\n2. It is usually found in books and articles the classification of enzymatic inhibition as competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive and mixed. Exposing the types of inhibition in this way can drive to a misunderstanding because the non-competitive inhibition is a subclass of mixed inhibition. Considering this the types of inhibition has to be exposed as competitive, uncompetitive and mixed inhibition. When the mixed inhibition presents the same value for both inhibition constants, the competitive (Ki) and the uncompetitive (Ki\u2019) components, it means Ki = Ki\u2019, the inhibition is denominated non-competitive. It is important to expose a correct classification of the types of inhibition to finish with the eternal misunderstanding.\n\r\n3. In line 76 the author indicated that the equations presented are unable to describe partial inhibition. This is correct. However, the inability to describe the partial inhibition is due to the origin of those equations which were obtained from reaction mechanisms describing total inhibition and not partial inhibition. Thereby, the inability in question was wrongly related to those equations when it should be related to the mechanisms proposed to derive those equations. \n\r\n4. In line 86 the author exposed that the catalytic activity of an enzyme is defined as the coordinates Km and Vmax. As I commented above, the enzymatic activity is obtained from an experimental assay in standard conditions. In this case the author has to talk about \u201creaction rate\u201d, which is the dependent variable in all the exposed rate equations (v). It is true that the activity is obtained through empirical determination of a reaction rate at certain operating conditions, however, a reaction rate is not necessarily the enzymatic activity. ", "Although the main points made in this paper are correct, the knowledge the author displays of the literature is completely inadequate, as one might guess from the fact that fewer than half of the references are to work done in the 21st century (not counting the author's own publications), and most of those that ARE from the 21st century address points of detail rather than the main thesis. C\u00f3rtes et al. (2001, Biochem. J. 357, 263-268) provided a more detailed account of the relationship between inhibition constants and IC50, and referred to an earlier study by Cheng and Prusoff (1973), that considered the same question. However, even 2001 is only just in the 21st century, so the author should read Baici's recent book (2015, Kinetics of Enzyme-Modifier Interactions, Springer) as well as reading the relevant papers that he cites.\n\r\nSebaugh's paper (2011) is addressed to pharmaceutical scientists, and it is absurd to say that it \"distill[s] inhibitory theory down to its most basic form\". It contains nothing that a biochemist would call inhibitory theory.\n\r\nThe paper by Tipton et al. (2014) is OK as far as it goes, but it says almost nothing relevant to the present paper. It does, however, include references to work the author should read. ", "This manuscript presents a package for analyzing enzyme kinetic data by means of global fitting within an Excel template.  The author argues that the common practice of characterizing kinetic data by visual examination of graphical representations often leads to oversimplified interpretations. The routines presented in the current work enable the simultaneous analysis of raw data according to standard models of competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive and mixed inhibition. A second template permits the analysis of the partial versions of these mechanisms. Both templates include an equation (the \u201cModifier\u201d equation ) incorporating all of the other mechanisms.  Vm, Km and Ki values are derived for each mechanism as well as the RSS measure of goodness of fit. The template thus offers a rapid and objective evaluation of different kinetic models and is potentially of considerable value to the field. The Figures in the manuscript mostly consist of clips from the Excel files included in the Supplementary material and are generally helpful summaries of the voluminous information contained in the spreadsheets.\r\nThe author argues that the conventional forms of enzyme kinetic equation are too complex and obscure the mode of action of inhibitors. The equation employed for the fitting involves a rearrangement of the more familiar format  to demonstrate separate effects of inhibitor or activator on apparent Km or Vm values. To this reviewer, the rearrangement is no simpler than the more traditional forms of the equation. This does not, however, invalidate the result and an alternative view may well be helpful to some.\r\nThe design of the work is acceptable. It employs data sets from other workers and subjects these data to the global fitting procedure to compare their fit to the various models employed. At one point in the manuscript, the utility of the process for determining competitive inhibition models is queried.  The author might consider testing the validity of the process by using  simulated data with zero errors, to determine if the fitting method does actually work for  this mode of inhibition and if so, how well.\r\nThe presentation of the work is has some other problems.  There is potential confusion for the reader in the use of Km, Ki and Vm which should be regarded as constants defining the enzyme. The author frequently  refers to the variation of Vm, Km or Ki under varied inhibitor or substrate concentrations\u2013 where what is meant is the apparent or measured Vm, Km or Ki. The distinction should be made clear throughout \u2013 perhaps by using italicized terms for the experimental values. In places the wording suggests that the Km or Ki represents the affinity of substrate or inhibitor for the enzyme, whereas they are inversely related to the affinity. This should be clarified.  Sometimes arguments are presented in prose that is difficult to understand and I recommend a careful reexamination of the text to remove such issues. Instances are given below.\r\nIn the spread sheets supporting the paper the results for different types of mechanism are compactly presented in the first sheet, with detailed information about each mechanism in the following sheets. In the first sheet, numerical results are presented, with values for Vms, and various K parameters. These Tables are presented in abbreviated form as Figures in the text.  The goodness of fit for each mechanism is illustrated via v vs s and 1/v vs 1/s plots. (I note that in the sheet1 of the S2 file, double reciprocal plots appear to be flat. A scale calculation appears to need adjustment.) Choice of the best fit mechanism(s) is made easily on the basis of RSS values. In some cases the fit to different models is very close. The inclusion of standard errors on the regression parameters would help to distinguish between alternatives in such cases since it is possible that an improved overall fit might result from inclusion of an additional but poorly defined parameter. \r\nThis reviewer suggests,  perhaps for future adoption, that in the templates for partial inhibition, inclusion of Dixon plots on Sheet 1 , may illustrate the partial nature of the inhibition better than the double reciprocal plots currently shown.\r\nIn some cases (e.g. in S9) the values shown in the summary table at the top of sheet are not reflected in the tables for individual mechanisms. Thus in S9 table for the modifier equation, values for Vmax 2 and Ki appear to have been interchanged  and  Km2 has acquired the value of Vmax.\r\nIn other instances, similar confusions may be found. In S13, the modifier equation shown in the bottom box contains the term Kx, rather than Ki. A value for Ki is given in the overall summary, but this value becomes that of Vm in the summary box at the bottom of the sheet. \r\nIt is not clear whether the author wishes the global fitting routines to be generally accessible. Pasting new data into the spreadsheets results in no progress beyond the initial estimates. If it is intended that the routines become generally available, some instruction as to the use of the global fitting routine would be valuable.\n\n\r\n\u2003\n\r\nMinor Issues:\r\nTitle: \u201c Modifier equations\u201d rather than \u201d modifiers equations\u201d\r\nLine 27: replace \u201cpseudo steady-state\u201d with \u201cRapid equilibrium\u201d.\r\nLine 30: change sentence after \u201cchanges in the\u2026. \u201c and substitute \u201cmeasured values of Vmax and Km\u201d\r\nLine 35: change \u2018\u2019would be\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2019is\u2019\u2019.\r\nLine 45: insert \u2018\u2019possible\u2019\u2019 after \u2018\u2019total\u201d , change \u201cturnover\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2019conversion\u2019\u2019\r\nLine 77: substitute \u2018\u2019absent\u201d for \u201cconspicuously missing\u201d.\r\nLine 85: insert after \u201cplot \u201d \u201cexperimentally determined values of \u201d\r\nline 90: change \u201caffinity\u201d to \u201caccess\u201d\r\nline 92: insert \u201capparent\u201d before \u201csubstrate\u201d and before \u201dKm\u201d\r\nLine 94: insert \u201capparent value of\u201d before \u201cVmax\u201d\r\nLine 98: change \u201cof\u201d to \u201cor\u201d\r\nLine 102 : IC50s\r\nLines 113-5: Meaning of this sentence unclear.\r\nLines 116-119: Sentence is incomplete.\r\nFor all equations: make sure equation number is aligned with the equation itself.\r\nLine 136 \u2013 139: Meaning is obscure.

It is suggested, though, that the use of simulated data with known (or zero) variability would enable a testing of the limitations of the approach. The presentation of this work is a little challenging, as discussed above, but there is no doubt that the analytical approach proposed may simplify and standardize the data analysis of experiments in which the mode of action of inhibitors or activators  of enzymes are the focus of the work. "], "6029": ["This a detailed work on enzymology, in the usual style of the laboratory. The interest of the research is clearly stated in the introduction and the experimental design is ok for me. The combination of biochemical experiments with complementary analyses in vivo using E. coly mutants make the results solid. I think the design is appropriate.\r\nI only have a minor question for the authors. It has been reported that some endonucleolytic repair activities are quite dependent on the sequence context. In particular I recall a work by the authors in which they show that uracil may be a substrate for APE1-mediated NIR, but this strongly depends on the sequence context. I wonder whether the authors have check MutY activity in different sequence contexts, in particular, mismatched DNA duplexes (AG/T=T or similar). My only main concern is the title of the work. I think that the title may be misleading. Negative results are still interesting, but the title suggests that MutY indeed has a role in UV-induced mutagenesis, while the clear conclusion of the paper is that MutY does not participate in that process. I suggest a title in line with the final conclusion.\r\nI also would like that more clear information would be included in the figures. For instance, in figure 1, it would be helpful to denote somehow the difference between the two substrates with T=T and the sequence context. Similarly, the authors should indicate that in figure 2 some lines are controls with ssDNA or the genotype of strains in figure 4. ", "The manuscript is generally well written, using clear English throughout, although there are a few minor grammatical errors in places which need correcting. This manuscript describes aims to understand whether MutY plays a role in the repair of adenine residues opposite cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4-photoproducts (6-4PP) generated by UV, and secondly whether MutY contributes to changes in mutation frequencies after UV irradiation. To my knowledge, this has not been investigated previously. The authors used a combination of in vitro biochemical assays using oligonucleotide substrates containing site specific CPD and 6-4PP damage in combination with MutY protein, and mutation frequency analysis in E.coli strains proficient or deficient in MutY following UV radiation. These experiments and results are all described and presented in sufficient detail.\r\nThe results from the study are largely against the hypothesis, but what these clearly demonstrate is that MutY is not capable of removing adenine opposite CPDs or 6-4PP in vitro from oligonucleotide substrates, but as expected is active in removal of adenine versus guanine or 8-oxoguanine (Figure 2 and 3). The authors also discovered that E.coli deficient in MutY do not harbour increased mutation frequencies in response to UV (Figure 5). However what they did find was an unexpected and interesting decrease in mutation frequency in MutY-deficient (BH980) and in MutY/NER (BH1220)-deficient strains. This decrease in mutation rates appeared to be dependent on the active protein, as demonstrated by complementation with wild type and not inactive MutY (Figure 5). The reason for this was not particular clear in the Discussion. Therefore my major comment would be to speculate on this finding given the observation that MutY clearly does not have an impact on repair of CPD or 6-4PP associated lesions at least in vitro.\n\r\nMinor comments:\r\n1. Some minor errors in grammar throughout the manuscript. For example, line 45 \u201cregular bases resulted from\u201c, should be \u201cregular bases resulting from\u201d; line 465 \u201cevidences are accumulated\u201d, should be \u201cevidence has accumulated\u201d. Line 486 should also state that \u201cMutY does not recognise A opposite CPD or 6-4PP in duplex DNA\u201d, to be more precise.\r\n2. A correction to Figure 5 is required (is the MutY-D138N strain mislabelled as BH10701070 rather than BH1070?).\r\n3. I suggest the incorporation of doses of UV radiation in Figures 4 and 5 for clarity, as these differ for the different strains. ", "While DNA repair pathways are guardians of the genome, aberrant activity of these pathways may increase mutagenesis. In the past, Saparbaev and colleagues have already characterized one such aberrant activity of a base excision repair pathway. In this work, considering the increased UV-sensitivity of human XP cells producing a MutY homolog, they tested both in vivo and in vitro the possibility that E. coli MutY will act aberrantly on the UV-lesions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts. \n\r\nThey assembled an oligonucleotide-based experimental system to detect MutY action on the strand opposite the pyrimidine dimers, using A-G mismatches as positive controls, but detected no cleavage, in two different sequence contexts. \n\r\nAt the same time, they show that in vivo, the mutY defect significantly (~10-fold) reduces increase in mutagenesis after UV, in both NER-proficient and -deficient backgrounds. The authors point out that this effect is due to the ~10-fold increase in the spontaneous mutagenesis in the mutY mutants. \r\n\tThey explore this point further, by predicting and then demonstrating that before UV, ~85% of all base substitutions in the mutY mutants were the expected G\u2014>T transversions, whereas after UV, ~70% of all base substitutions became C\u2014>T transitions, indicative of TLS polymerase errors at pyrimidine dimers. \n\r\nFinally, they consider published crystal structures and argue using measurements of inter-atomic distances that the structure of B-DNA around PD is significantly different from the structure of B-DNA around the A-oG mispair, apparently precluding recognition of the former by MutY enzyme.  \n\n\n\r\nMajor points\n\r\n(May be in the future, but\u2026) I would also look at the opposite (PD-containing) strand for any MutY cleavage, just in case.  \n\n\r\nMinor points\n\r\nIt would be nice if the MS had page numbers. In the absence of these, I have assigned page 6 of the MS file (the title page) number 1, while all other pages are listed in relation to page 6. For example, Abstract is on page 3, while Introduction begins on page 5. \n\r\nOn page 13 (say, line 328), the authors should call mutY mutants this very name, or, at the least, should explain that micA is the mutY equivalent, \u2014 otherwise confusing. Also, the micA mutants are not BER-deficient, \u2014 they are deficient only in MutY! \n\r\nOn page 13 again, lines 340/341, I suggest to drop AB1157 results altogether, since the meaningful comparison here is between the uvrA and uvrA mutY mutants. This will allow to shorten the corresponding sentence and to combine the two current sentences on lines 340-345 into a single logical construct. \n\r\nPage 18, lines 461-463 \u2014 this statement needs a citation (probably PMID: 26317348). \n\r\nFig. 6 \u2014 an explanatory panel showing the relevant structures would be helpful here.  \n\r\nTable 3 \u2014 in AB1157, the second category of base substitutions is T\u2014>C, whereas for all other strains it is G\u2014>T.

The authors should include at least one statement. ", "The article is quite clearly written but the backgound to the study is not adequately presented. There is an extensive literature on the biological properties of the dermaseptins from multiple species including antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity to tumor cells that should be reviewed for the reader. The relevant results do not support the claim that the peptides are anticancer (see General Comments). The topic of the research is within the scope of the journal and the experiments appear to have been performed to a satisfactory technical standard. A serious  limitation of the study is that no attempt has been made to show that the dermaseptins are actually produced by the frogs and have the structures predicted from the nucleotide sequences of cDNAs \r\nThe frogs in question presumably synthesize a wide range of host-defense peptide including not only dermaseptins but also phylloseptins, dermatoxins, and others. The study has been submitted for publication at a too preliminary stage and would be improved enormously if a comprehensive account of the full range of peptides produced by these species were provided rather than just two peptides whose selection for publication is not explained.In its present form, the article does not fill an identified knowledge gap.\r\nPredictions of secondary structure are not of great value. As the authors have performed CD measurements, the data should be analyzed quantitatively to determine % helicity.\r\n. The validity of the findings are called into question by the fact that no attempt has been made to confirm the identity of the frogs or to state where they were collected. It is simply stated that they were provided by a commercial supplier. The reader must be certain that the animals used really are the species that they are claimed to be. \r\nIn order to justify the claim that the dermaseptins are active against drug-resistant bacteria, MIC values against a wider ranger of clinical isolates whose resistance profile is fully characterized are needed.The present study involves the use of a single NCTC strain.\r\nAs regards potential as \"anticancer\" agents, the authors should compare the cytotoxicities against tumor cells of their peptides with those of other dermaseptins previously described.\r\nAlthough the authors claim that the properties of the conjugate are \"significantly better\" than the native peptide, no statistical analysis is presented. The authors are not justified in using the term anticancer. For an agent to be described as anticancer it must produce tumor shrinkage in humans. To use the term antitumor, the agent must produce tumor shrinkage in an animal model. The authors has shown only that the dermaseptins are cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro.\r\nPhllomedusa duellmani has now been reclassified as Callimedusa duellmani. and should be referred to as such. ", "The manuscript submitted by Zhu et al. describes the identification of two novel dermaseptins from two different cDNA libraries from two species of Phyllomedusa frogs. In addition, the authors report on the antimicrobial, hemolytic and anticancer properties of the natural peptides. By creating structural analogs of DRS-DU-1, the authors confirm the essential role of the N-terminal part of the peptide for the biological activity, as well as design a TAT-fusion N-terminus-truncated version with enhanced anticancer activity. The later serves as an example of strategy that can be used in designing novel antimicrobial and anticancer therapeutic agents that lack hemolytic activity. \r\nThe manuscript can be accepted for publication. However, the authors need to  respond to the following comments before the paper is published:\r\n1.\tI would strongly encourage the authors to think about modifying the title of the paper. The way it is written now, it is not clear and doesn\u2019t provide enough information about the content of the paper. \r\n2.\tThe article overall is written in clear and unambiguous English language. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed: typos with the name of the peptides \u2013 dermaspetin (example l. 165, 233); the names of the frogs should be given as P. camba and P. duellmani throughout the text after the first time they appear in full. 3. The experimental design is straightforward, and the research questions are well stated. \r\n4. Even though the information included in the Introduction is enough to justify the antimicrobial part of the work, it doesn\u2019t familiarize the reader about the reasons for studying the anticancer effect of the peptides and their analogs on various tumor cell lines. More information needs to be included to show context. In my opinion, the study is technically sound and the conclusions are supported by the results. It is important that the authors discuss their findings comparing them to reports by others on the antimicrobial, hemolytic and anticancer activity of dermaseptins.

"], "5598": ["There is no direct evidence that the interaction between MOS9 and CHS is related to the ETI response. The manuscript need to contain results relevant to the ETI response. Ideally, OX-MOS9 transgenic lines with tt4-11 background are inoculated with an incompatible pathogen and their disease symptoms are evaluated to test whether the interaction between MOS9 and CHI influences the ETI response. Lines 292-294. \r\nThe comparison of the YFP fluorescence between MOS9 in WT and CHS-deficient roots needs a standard to evaluate difference in the fluorescence between them. For example, overexpression of another fluorescent protein such as CFP and RFP can be used as the standard. This is because differences in fluorescence between transgenic plant lines expressing the same fluorescent protein driven by the same promoter are commonly observed even when images are taken under identical conditions. It is difficult to see that de35S::MOS9::YFP lines share substantial changes of the metabolites including phenylpropanoid and flavonoid compounds with mos9-2 and tt4-11 from Table 2 (lines 437-442). This is because de35S::MOS9::YFP lines and mos-9 have different signs (plus or minus) of ratio of change for syringaresinol hexoside, monomer and biflavonoid of quercetin rhamnoside, UNK glycerolipids in Table 2. Coexpression of MOS9 and CHS was observed in the root tissues. If the hypothesis that the interaction is involved in the ETI response is correct, the interaction does not influence ETI response in the leaf, does not it? More explanations are needed. ", "Watkinson et al described the identification of a novel interaction partner of CHS, the nuclear localized protein MOS9 that potentially involved in regulation of effector-triggered immunity. The authors further observed that upregulation of MOS9 gene expression suppressed CHS gene expression and affect the accumulation of a set of phenylalanine-derived metabolites. Overall the manuscript is well written and nicely organized. This is an explorative work, in which the authors intended to identify additional proteins interacting with CHS via yeast two hybrid screening, followed with SPR and FLIM-FRET analyses to validate the recognized interactions. Such experiments were designed properly and sound. The methods are clearly described. While the discovery and confirmation of CHS-MOS interaction is convincing, the biological relevance of such protein-protein interaction seems less solidly elucidated. The authors observed the effects of overexpression of MOS9 on CHS transcript and the synthesis of a set of metabolites. But there is no any directly data support the observed protein-protein interaction of MOS9 and CHS has any link with transcriptional suppression of CHS. With such concern, I feel it is not so valid to conclude that \u201cthese findings \u2026point to a role for this newly identified partner in suppressing CHS gene expression through interaction with CHS protein in the nucleus (Discussion Lines 405-406)\u201d\n\r\nAlso the authors deduced that \u201cthe interaction of MOS9 diverts CHS from its cytosolic catalytic function\u201d. To make this notion confirmatory, probably it needs more experimental data to support, e.g. the data on whether CHS\u2019s subcellular localization could be quantitatively altered under co-expression of MOS9.\n\r\nRegarding FLIM-FRET in mesophyll protoplast, it is not clear whether the FRET efficiency was calculated from the fluorescence within entire protoplast or in nucleus. It would be better that the authors could present the related fluorescent imaging data showing the co-localization of CHS and MOS9  (theoretically in nucleus). Overall the manuscript describes a nice discovery, which could help to further understand the CHS- mediated protein complex and its potential interplay with other biological process ", "I believe that the style of this paper fulfills the Basic reporting criteria of the Journal. Overall, the experimental designs described in this paper appear to fulfill the criteria of the Journal. This paper reports on the finding concerning the interaction of CHS with a nuclear-localized protein (MOS9) that is linked to epigenetic control of genes mediating ETI. Although CHS has been known to be localized not only in cytoplasm but also in nucleus, physiological significance of its nuclear localization has been elusive. Therefore, the findings reported in this paper may provide useful information for insights into the possible role(s) of nuclear-localized CHS.\n\r\n1. Line 352: .... overall reduced flavonol accumulation ...:\r\nTable 2 shows ratios of changes without contents. Because triflavonoid showed 5.0-fold increase in de35S::MOS9::YFP, it cannot be concluded, without showing the contents, that total flavonols were reduced in de35S::MOS9::YFP, even though other flavonol species showed diminished changes. Please clarify.\n\r\n2. Discussion section\r\nThe interaction of CHS and MOS9 has been unambiguously identified, but unfortunately the CHS transcription and metabolomics results obtained were only poorly discussed in terms of the observed CHS/MOS9 interaction. The reduced CHS transcript levels and the reduced flavonol levels observed upon MOS overexpression might be explained without considering the interaction of MOS9 with CHS but physiological significance of the interaction could be discussed. \n\r\n2-1. The results reported show that CHS transcript levels were reduced upon the overexression of MOS9. This reviewer wonders whether this observation could be discussed in conjunction with the formation of the CHS/MOS9 complex. MOS9 appears to be constitutively expressed in plant (as mentioned on line 444) and was relatively unresponsive across a range of perturbations (line 302). Then what is the role of the CHS/MOS9 complex formation? Would it be possible to discuss such a scenario that excess CHS molecules in cytoplasm get into the nucleus and bind to the constitutive MOS9 to produce a small amount of the CHS/MOS9 complex, which in turn reduces the CHS transcript levels in a negative feedback manner?\n\r\n2-2. If total flavonol glycosides indeed diminish upon the overexression of MOS9, this reviewer wonders whether it would be possible to elaborate/discuss this observation in terms of the formation of the CHS/MOS9 complex. For example, overproduction of MOS9 protein might result in the removal of CHS protein from cytoplasm (or ER-localized flavonoid metabolon) by incorporating it into nucleus.\n\r\n2-3. Small amounts of flavonoids could be produced via reactions catalyzed by nuclear-localized flavonoid enzymes (including CHS) in the nucleus and exert some regulatory role(s) during gene expression events. Would it be possible that MOS9 plays a role to inhibit nuclear production of flavonoids by its binding to CHS? In this case, it would be interesting to examine whether CHS activity is inhibited by MOS9 binding. Do authors have any in vitro data concerning this? Minor comment:\n\r\nTable 2.\r\nIt would be better to express fold changes of reduction, for example, as 0.244 and 0.083 rather than \u20134.1 and \u201312.1, respectively. Please consider.

I would recommend they look at these conclusions again before publication. Specifically this relates to line 267 and Figure 6. Here the authors have shown the Paeruginosa TonB sequence (beta-5 strand) and how it might bind to the Ecoli BtuB sequence. They used the Ecoli sequence since there is no structure available for the Paeruginosa BtuB or other TBDT. However, there is a sequence (as opposed to structure) available for the Paeruginosa BtuB protein, and a sequence alignment could be carried out to look at the actual interacting residues in the correct species.

In the work by Yaacob and co-workers, authors have synthetized a calixarene framework functionalized bio-polymeric magnetic composite and used it for the magnetic solid-phase extraction (m-dSPE) of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from tap, drinking and river water samples prior their determination by HPLC-DAD. In particular, authors carried out a suitable characterization of the sorbent by FT-IR, XRD, FESEM, EDX, VSM and BET analysis. They also optimized parameters such as sorbent amount, extraction time, sample volume, type and volume of elution solvent, desorption time and pH of the sample in order to maximize the extraction efficiency of the procedure. Finally, the methodology was validated and applied to real sample analysis. However, and despite the interest of the use of this sorbent, some aspects, especially related with the optimization of the extraction procedure, preclude the publication of this manuscript in this journal:\r\n1)\tDuring the optimization of the extraction, authors selected 30 minutes as the time which provided the highest peak areas. Although it seems to be justified by the data shown in Figure 7 (A), 30 minutes is a relatively long extraction time. Considering that the next value that is below is 20 minutes, authors should have done some tests between 20 and 30 minutes of extraction to check if peak areas decreased or not. They should have tried to reduce the extraction time.\r\n2)\tThe values of peak areas obtained with 10 minutes of elution are practically the same as those obtained with 5 minutes. Moreover, the repeatability obtained in both cases is also very similar. However, authors opted for 10 minutes. \r\n3)\tRegarding the elution step, ACN was selected as the elution solvent which provided the highest peak areas. However, MeOH was the best solvent for the elution of fenoprofen and similar recoveries were found for another analyte in both cases. Thus, a mixture of both sorbents should have been tested. Authors commented that when more than 1.5 mL of ACN were used, the peak areas decreased due to the dilution factor. However, such decrease is not justified since in the description of the m-dSPE procedure they say that the elution extract was dried and then reconstituted in 0.7 mL of ACN. If that is so, the peak area should be practically the same using 1.5 mL or using higher volumes, considering that this volume is enough for the complete elution of the target analytes. On the contrary, the values obtained with 2 and 2.5 mL of ACN are very similar to the ones obtained with 0.5 and 1.0 mL.\r\n4)\tAuthors say that best peak areas are obtained at pH 4 and they try to justify it by means of the pKa of the analytes. However, considering the pKa values of these analytes, at pH 4 some of them will be ionized while others will be in their neutral form. Therefore, peak area values obtained at pH 4 are not justified. Further tests should be done at pH 3 and 5.\r\nIn conclusion, the optimization of the methodology was not properly developed, some experiments are missing, results are not properly justified and some of them are incongruous. The bad experimental design make that the obtained results are not reliable. In the work by Yaacob and co-workers, authors have synthetized a calixarene framework functionalized bio-polymeric magnetic composite and used it for the magnetic solid-phase extraction (m-dSPE) of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from tap, drinking and river water samples prior their determination by HPLC-DAD. In particular, authors carried out a suitable characterization of the sorbent by FT-IR, XRD, FESEM, EDX, VSM and BET analysis. They also optimized parameters such as sorbent amount, extraction time, sample volume, type and volume of elution solvent, desorption time and pH of the sample in order to maximize the extraction efficiency of the procedure. Finally, the methodology was validated and applied to real sample analysis. However, and despite the interest of the use of this sorbent, some aspects, especially related with the optimization of the extraction procedure, preclude the publication of this manuscript in this journal:\r\n1)\tDuring the optimization of the extraction, authors selected 30 minutes as the time which provided the highest peak areas. Although it seems to be justified by the data shown in Figure 7 (A), 30 minutes is a relatively long extraction time. Considering that the next value that is below is 20 minutes, authors should have done some tests between 20 and 30 minutes of extraction to check if peak areas decreased or not. They should have tried to reduce the extraction time.\r\n2)\tThe values of peak areas obtained with 10 minutes of elution are practically the same as those obtained with 5 minutes. Moreover, the repeatability obtained in both cases is also very similar. However, authors opted for 10 minutes. \r\n3)\tRegarding the elution step, ACN was selected as the elution solvent which provided the highest peak areas. However, MeOH was the best solvent for the elution of fenoprofen and similar recoveries were found for another analyte in both cases. Thus, a mixture of both sorbents should have been tested. Authors commented that when more than 1.5 mL of ACN were used, the peak areas decreased due to the dilution factor. However, such decrease is not justified since in the description of the m-dSPE procedure they say that the elution extract was dried and then reconstituted in 0.7 mL of ACN. If that is so, the peak area should be practically the same using 1.5 mL or using higher volumes, considering that this volume is enough for the complete elution of the target analytes. On the contrary, the values obtained with 2 and 2.5 mL of ACN are very similar to the ones obtained with 0.5 and 1.0 mL.\r\n4)\tAuthors say that best peak areas are obtained at pH 4 and they try to justify it by means of the pKa of the analytes. However, considering the pKa values of these analytes, at pH 4 some of them will be ionized while others will be in their neutral form. Therefore, peak area values obtained at pH 4 are not justified. Further tests should be done at pH 3 and 5.\r\nIn conclusion, the optimization of the methodology was not properly developed, some experiments are missing, results are not properly justified and some of them are incongruous.\r\nOther specific comments:\r\n-\tAuthors selected 30 mg of sorbent as the amount which provided the highest peak areas. However, the explanation they gave to justify the decreasing in peak areas when higher amounts of sorbent were used is not clear. Authors should rewrite this or find a suitable explanation to this fact.\r\n-\tEnglish should be revised by a native speaker throughout the manuscript.

", "This work described the fabrication and characterization of a material for MSPE, and its performance for extracting several pharmaceuticals were assessed.\r\nThe paper was written in a logical order, with clear language. Literature review was comprehensive, and sufficient background was provided in the introduction.\r\nThe structure of this paper is well organized, with raw data shared in supporting information. So in general, I think this work meet the standard of PeerJ, and should be accepted for publication after minor revisions. The research question was relevant and clearly defined. Well controlled experiments were conducted, and methods were described with enough details that readers should be able to replicate. From the information provided, the investigation was performed to a high standard. Most of the data look solid and convincing, and the figures and tables support the conclusions. The conclusions are well stated, and \r\nThe only two questions I have on the results are:\r\n1, the use of peak areas as a measure of analytes concentration, in Figure 6,7,8,9 and SI 4. I understand that all the recoveries are based on relative comparison, but why not quantify the concentration in accurate units?\r\n2, the authors mentioned recoveries in the text, but I did not see the baseline (100%) in any of those bar plots. This cause some difficulties when connecting the text to the figures. Standard bars or a horizontal lines should present in those figures. Line 56, \"These drugs pose toxic effects in aquatic ecosystems and may cause harm to not only marine life but also to humans\"you will need reference for such statement.\r\nFigure 1, I see there is some notice about \"Auto Gamma Correction\" used, which seems to blur the figure. After all, these are common pharmaceuticals, why not just use plain presentation for the structures (like those in Figure 2)? ", "A more sufficient survey of background should be performed, please focus on the synthesis of calixarene modified magnetic nanoparticles. The relative information should be added in Introduction. Overall, the experimental design of this manuscript was quite thorough, except that the adsorption capacity of the synthesized nano composite should be better added. The author synthesized calixarene-grafted biopolymeric magnetic nanocomposite, and used it as the adsorption medium for the analysis of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in environmental water. The nanocomposite was carefully characterized, the extraction conditions were thoroughly evaluated, and compared to previously reported methods, the proposed method exhibited a better performance. However, there are some issues need to be addressed before publication. Therefore, I suggestion a major revision of this manuscript should be made before the acceptance by Peer J. The specific comments are listed as follows. \r\n1.\tIn the Introduction, the instable property of naked MNPs in acidic environment or other harsh condition were indicated as a disadvantage. However, Fe3O4 was immobilized on the surface of the designed nanocomposite, thus directly exposed to acidic solution when extracting samples. It seems controversial. Please revise the manuscript to make the points consistently. \r\n2.\tMany calixarene modified magnetic nanoparticles were reported so far. Please compare the advantages of the prepared nanoparticles with the reported ones in the aspect of synthetic methods, etc. \r\n3.\tPlease indicate the binding mechanism of caixarene with guest molecules more clearly. Are there other interactions existed aside from pai-pai stacking interaction, hydrophobic or hydrophilic interaction? In other words, why can NSAIDs be selectively extracted by caixarene modified nanocomposite?\r\n4.\tAn adsorption isotherm and adsorption capacity should be investigated to elucidate the adsorption behavior between sorbent and NSAID. \r\n5.\tIt would be better if Figures 6-9 could be merged into one. "], "5163": ["The manuscript is well-written to present the structure of the Acinus RRM domain. There are a few points which could be improved:\n\r\nLine 33:  \"includes the RRM domain\" - This makes it sound as though the RRM is part of p17 and not vice versa.\n\r\nLine 36: location of the caspase-3 target sequence - the text in parenthesis - typically, the references are made starting from the N-terminus and going towards the C-terminus.

And, maybe even include some background on the C-terminal helix (Optional).    \n\r\nLine 182: Artifact spelling\n\r\nLine 260: \"right in the middle\" - it is a little colloquial\n\r\nFigure 2 Legend last line - it should be disulfide \"bond\"\n\r\nI would like to add that the figures are well made and the consistency in the color scheme is definitely helpful to the reader. The color for the RNA strand in Figure 6B could be changed to better distinguish it (optional).

While, the article discusses the findings from overlaying with RNA15 and U1A (basically figure 4 and 6), the discussion for figure 5 is missing. Rest of the figures have a clear finding that adds to the story and conclusions of the paper. But, what is being learnt from figure 5 that gets added to the conclusion of the entire paper?\n\r\nI would like to add that the comparison with RNA15 and U1A are well presented. \r\nThough for figure 4A : the PDB for RNA15 shows the presence of a C-terminal helix, which is missing in the figure. I would like to commend the authors on successfully solving the structure of Acinus RRM. Overall, the manuscript is well written and conveys the relevance of the work. ", "The article is written in a clear language and is easy to read.\r\nThe introduction is well written and serves to place the research into the structural and biology context. Nevertheless I found the sentence in line 71 a bit confusing because it is not clear to me if serine phosphorylation refers to caspase-3 residues or to acinus (they seem to be very far from the RRM). It is also unclear to me if caspase-3 also causes cleavage at N-terminus of Acinus p17 form\r\nFigures are of high quality, although it is advisable to include labels for secondary structure elements for easy following descriptions in the text. In particular when comparing with other RRM structures.\r\nReferences are well chosen in general. Perhaps the example of Csft64 (Perez-Canadillas and Varani 2003, EMBO J) should be mentioned in line 255 as an early case of a C-terminal helix blocking the RNA binding interface.\r\nThe PDB code (6G6S) of AcRRM should be reported in the article and in Figure 2\n\r\nThe PDB validation report has been provided. The structural data is of good quality. Molecular biology and crystallographic methods are described in good detail. \n\r\nI noticed this RRM domain has not been automatically annotated in the protein database, perhaps due to non-canonical RNP1 and RNP2 motifs. Because no experimental binding data has been presented, discussion about the RNA recognition properties should be based in a thorough bioinformatics analysis. However I believe that it is poorly presented in this case. For instance in figure 3 B a conservation map is shown over the structure, however it is not clear which Acinus homologues have been chosen to build this map. A figure with a sequence alignment of acinus homologues from different species should be provided at least as supplementary data. \r\nI have check (blast) that Acinus RRM is very similar to Fox1 with sequence identity much higher (around 31%) than for UA1 and RNA15. Structural comparison with Fox1 should be included in the analysis (lines 200 to 208) The article describes the structure of human Acinus RNA recognition motif that contain a basic RRM-like fold with an extra C-terminus helix. Although there are similar structures with this extra secondary element in similar configuration, the novelty of Acinus RRM is that the C-terminal helix contains the cleavage site of caspase-3, which is being proposed by the authors as a possible regulator of RNA binding activity. Nevertheless such hypothesis is only presented at theoretical level and there is not experimental validation. The article would benefit from doing simple binding experiments (e.g. EMSA with Acinus RRM and C-terminal truncated mutants).\r\nThe protein crystalizes as a disulphide crosslinked dimer (Figure 2). In my opinion, authors overlook the potential biological significance of this finding. They mention cysteine 1083 is conserved across species but at the same time claim that the disulphide bridge is probably a crystallization artefact. It should be noticed that the RNA binding properties of a dimer would be dramatically different to the monomer. Hence a more detailed investigation of the oligomerization state of this protein in solutions seems mandatory to me. I would suggest simple gel filtration experiments comparing wild type and C1083 mutant (e.g. to Ser) behaviour under oxidizing and reducing conditions.\n\r\nIn my opinion some parts of the article are of little relevance and describe vague concepts:\r\nLines between 209 and 213 describe two very small insertions in loops, which I think of little significance giving the high variability of loops across the different RRMs. I recommend removing this paragraph.\r\nLines 269-278 discuss some common themes in RRM RNA recognition, suggesting that Acinus RRM might follow similar strategies. But there are no real evidences/clues/hints in this work that support any of these mechanisms, apart that the RRM fold. I regard this part as superfluous At the light of the structure, the potential biological significance of AcRRM dimerization should be experimentally addressed or at least discussed in comparison with other RRM homodimers \n\r\nComparative band shift experiments with wild-type and a C-terminal truncated version (at caspase site) should be performed to provide some experimental foundations for the discussion.

Line 210. It is not clear what the authors mean by \"three unique subunits\". Presumably there are three different conformations of monomers in the crystal, but this should be better explained.\n\r\n2. Multiple references in the text and the list are incomplete or need reformatting. The authors should also group their references, when successive, together in a single pair of brackets. Examples include lines 47, 62, 224 and all references in the Discussion.  Several references have parts missing or are misformatted in the list (e.g. lines 394, 404, 406, 421, 433, 437, 475, 480). The authors describe purification and biochemical analysis of FlaI, the hexameric ATPase and the main motor of the system, and FlaH, an ATP-binding protein of the RecA family. The quality of this work meets the high standards and is supported by quantitative approach.\n\n\r\nThe authors show that Pyrococcus FlaI can be purified to homogeneity and behaves as a hexamer, even in the absence of ATP or analogues. unlike Sulfolobus FlaI used as a control. The authors further show that Pf FlaI binds ATP in vitro at a 3:1 molar ratio, suggesting that only two ATP binding sites are accessible in the hexamer and leading the authors to deduce a two-fold symmetry of the hexamer. Using the purified FlaI Pf the authors analyze the kinetic constants, optimum temperature and pH for its ATPase activity. \n\r\nThe two domains of FliI were produced separately and their multimeric state was tested by SEC. These experiments show that the N-terminal domain alone behaves as a hexamer whereas the C-terminal domain was monomeric. When the two domains were mixed, the C-domain co-eluted with the N-domain multimer, and this interaction was required for reconstitution of ATPase activity. \r\nNext, the ATP binding protein FlaH was purified and its ability to stimulate FlaI ATPase activity was demonstrated in vitro. This stimulation required intact walker A and walker B boxes of FlaH. When FlaH was added to FlaI variant defective for ATPase activity, no ATP hydrolysis was detected, demonstrating that FlaH is unable to hydrolyse ATP, even in the presence of FlaI.\n\r\nFinally, using microscale thermophoresis, the authors determined FliH binding affinities of to the N- and C-terminal domains of FlaI.  These experiments showed higher affinity of FliH to the C-terminal domain, which was even higher than that observed for the FlaI hexamer. The C-terminal binding and 1:1 stoichiometry is consistent with positioning of FlaH hexamer underneath the FlaI hexamer at the base of the archaellum. Overall, the experiments are well executed and support the conclusions. Proper controls are included in the experiments and statistical analysis is applied.\n\r\nThe Discussion highlights differences between Sulfolobus and Pyrococcus FlaI and the role of N-domain oligomerization in ATPase activity and in the cooperativity of the process. The results are placed in the context of recent structural data obtained by crystallography and cryo-tomography in different species.

With that said, I must make the following observations:\n\r\n\t\u2022\tWhen publishers recommend the deposition of data into repositories, they are often very explicit in their instructions, naming specific repositories that comply with their requirements (e.g. Dryad and figshare).\r\n\t\u2022\tIf the purpose of the guidelines is to improve manuscripts, compliance by authors is important. Even precise and strict requirements often have very low compliance from the authors (example, data policy from PLOS). Without clear instructions of where and how to deposit protocols, changes to guidelines may become meaningless.\r\n\t\u2022\tThere are additional considerations when publishers or funders suggest or require the use of specific platforms or resources, even at the cost of liberty to the researchers. For example, specifying GitHub as the platform of choice for code-sharing may be somewhat restrictive. At the same time, if the funder wants to encourage collaboration between the grantees, guiding everyone to the same platform is reasonable.\r\n\t\u2022\tIdeally, recommended platforms and repositories should meet a set of requirements (preservation plans, archiving, backups, open APIs, open access, sustainability), but if they do, as I write above, specifying a given resource or resources may be warranted. Imagine if instead of GenBank, the scientists in the Human Genome Project had the freedom to deposit their sequences in any database of their choice. Chromosome I would be in one place, Chromosome 2 in another, and it would be impossible to query all of the genome from a single source.\n\r\nThis manuscript is nicely referenced, but for the argument above, I do not see any prior evidence or analysis that supports the recommendation of the authors. It is critical to balance authors\u2019 freedom with the needs of readers, the barriers to adoption and compliance, and so forth.\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nMINOR ISSUES\n\r\na) Grammar/spelling:\n\r\nWhile the paper is very clear, accessible, and well organized, it does require a careful editing review for grammar. There are many examples of errors such as:\n\r\n\t\u2022\t\u201cRather that\u201d -> \u201crather than\u201d\r\n\t\u2022\t\u201cthe SP checklist aim\u201d -> \u201cthe SP checklist aims\u201d\r\n\t\u2022\t\u201cshouldn\u2019t researchers be hold\u201d -> \u201cshouldn\u2019t research be held\u201d\r\n\t\u2022\t\u201cMethods X\u201d is erroneously \u201cMethod X\u201d in references\r\n\t\u2022\t\u201cThis guideline guideline describes\u201d -> \u201cThis guideline describes\u201d\r\n\t\u2022\t\u201cthe\u201d should be removed in front of %s, as in \u201cthe 100% of the domain experts\u201d should just be \u201c100% of the domain experts\u201d.\n\r\nb) \u201cSMART\u201d looks like an acronym for something but is never defined. Perhaps \u201cstructured\u201d or \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cdetailed, structured protocols\u201d should be part of the name of the guidelines?\n\r\nc) NPE is called a journal here; it is not. Protocol Exchange is a repository, similar to protocols.io. They do not perform peer review, but the authors write on page 5, \u201cAnalyzing protocols\u201d that the published protocols in their analyses were all peer-reviewed.\n\r\nd) Instead of \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d example on page 10, consider rephrasing as \u201ccomplete\u201d versus \u201cincomplete\u201d or \u201cdetailed\u201d versus ambiguous.\n\r\ne) On page 10, under Bibliographic data elements, the authors recommend \u201c50 character\u201d or fewer. That seems much too short. Perhaps it\u2019s a mistake and was meant to be \u201c50 words\u201d? The example of a good title in this section actually has 130 characters.\n\r\nf) When mentioning \u201cprotocols.io\u201d on page 11, you may want to cite the following publication:      https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002538. ", "The article address an interest topic in the context of reproducible science.\r\nwhile the intent is laudable, the overall read could be easier by avoiding repetitions (e.g in the abstract \"xperimental protocols are key elements when planning, doing and reporting research. Experimental\r\nprotocols are central to research methodologies\")\n\r\nAlso transitions between sentences / idea developed are often abrupt or imprecise (e.g. \"Experimental protocols are crucial for the execution and reproducibility of any study, the reporting structure remains highly idiosyncratic. However, there is little consistency in the data elements that should be included; the required data elements to be reported within the same discipline vary from publisher to publisher\")\n\r\nThe use of 'However' is not suited. So it may be necessary to have the manuscript proof-read by a native speaker to catch these issues.\n\r\nThe manuscript would be greatly improved if the authors could review their draft to really streamline the reading experiment, paying particular attention to the logical transition between sections and thoughts.\n\n\r\nThe next sentence moves immediately into a specific observation (\"Kilkenny et al. (2010a) evaluated 271 journal articles, they found that 4% did not report the number of\r\nanimals used anywhere in the methods or the results sections. \") which somehow conflicts with the previous statement in the fact that this reference indicates that 96% of authors did report sample sizes, which seems pretty consistent.\n\r\nFurthermore, while the authors pick up on how important sample size is, it does not make to final cut of things to report about experimental procedures.\r\nThis leads to my next comment :\r\nIt would be great to have a delineation of scope for what a protocol is. In clinical context it has a different meaning that in say 'wet lab/molecular biology' context. This has huge implication into what needs to be reported.\n\n\r\nBackground / state of the art.\r\nThe authors may wish to consider efforts such RRID (https://www.force11.org/group/resource-identification-initiative)\r\nMore specifically, they could also identify and clearly name major efforts that effectively aim at normalization description of hardware, antibodies and plasmids. The resources are \n\nhttps://accessgudid.nlm.nih.gov/\r\nwww.antibodyregistry.org\r\nwww.addgene.org\n\r\nwhile RIP (resource information portal) is mentioned, the authors fail to place in context its importantce Methodology:\r\nThe authors should clarify the inclusion criteria for selecting the resource they have analyzed.\n\r\nIn particular, with regard to the semantic artefacts considered, UBERON and NCBI Tax seem quite remote from anything related to describing protocols.\r\nSo it seems that section would benefit from distinguishing resources to use as fillers for properties (UBERON,NCBITax,CHEBI) from resources modeling the domain (OBI,BAO,CHMO,EXPO,...)\n\r\nThen, not much information is available as to what methods were applied to analyse the corpus of data that had been assembled. Was text-mining used? What kind of metrics the authors devised?\r\nFor instance, in figure 1 (which is quite nice), a question is 'were protocols described as required by instructions to authors'. Was it done entirely manually ? were there rule based classifiers? was a croud sourcing effort implemented?\n\n\r\nBut above all, it would be interesting to have the authors discuss the values of 'checklist' in the absence of machine validation?\r\nIt would be more important to provide data reporting templates (metadata profiles, configurations) Results:\n\r\nline194(9), the link 'https://github.com/oxgiraldo/SMART-Protocols/tree/master/SP' returns a 404 but https://github.com/oxgiraldo/SMART-Protocols/ is accessible\r\nand the following seems to work\n\r\nWhy not presenting this table in the main results rather than sending it to the supplementary section?\n\nhttps://github.com/oxgiraldo/SMART-Protocols/tree/master/SP%20checklist\n\n\r\nLooking at the protocol checklist, I am surprised to find a specific item for 'PCR primers'. while those are critical for any amplification based protocol, would it have been to general it to 'nucleic acid', where primers but also oligo-probes, vectors, antisense RNA,....\r\nWhy this selection?\n\n\r\nWhile the table is easy to produce and useful, having a machine readable version for instance in the form of JSON schema, with a JSON LD context file which would provide a semantic markup.\r\nIt would be a much more modern representation and above all actionable form of the checklist.\r\nAlso, it would allow introducing the ontology produced by the authors and which is burried deep into the text. Discussion:\n\r\nPutting Biosharing and initiative such as ARRIVE and STAR is incorrect and possibly misleading.\r\nBiosharing is a catalogue of resources about standard terminologies, policies,formats such as ARRIVE or STAR, but does not constitute a recommendation itself. I would encourage the authors to amend to manuscript accordingly (line 408 but also at the begining line 49)\n\r\nThe discussion would benefit from a rewrite as it feels as if many ideas were thrown in but lack clear focus. For instance, @line 432, the authors state \"By the same token, our approach complement the ISA tools effort (Sansone et al., 2012)\" but it is unclear how? this is where I would find the major weakness in the work presented. it is always oscillating between 'a simple checklist' or a 'structured specification'. This would require addressing.\n\n\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nLine 456: \"Publishers SHOULD NOT enforce the use of a particular repository or journal.\"\r\nthere seems to be a typographic error with 'should not' appearing in bold capital. This makes the whole sentence appear very loud.  and as it stands, I would strongly disagree with that statement.\n\r\nOverall, the message is very unclear as what should be done : recommendation/enforcement. The main reason for heterogeneous reporting is the existence of loopholes, the lack of tools to automatically extract and markup entities and that fact in some cases, (patents) exact protocols and methods can simply not be shared. This is not discussed and may be having a few words would not hurt.\n\n\n\r\nminor:\r\npage 1, line 44: s/founders/funders/\r\npage 16, line 412: s/routinary/routinely\n\r\nLine 458: Please consider exchanging imprescindible with \"essential\".\n\r\nthe authors should cite MIBBI as follows:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18688244 or 10.1038/nbt.1411 ", "1)  Clear, unambiguous, professional English language used throughout.\r\n\tThe manuscript needs to be reviewed for English.  It's not bad, but there are a lot of grammatical errors and non-standard usage.\n\r\n2)  Intro & background to show context:\n\r\nI don\u2019t think that the introduction sets up the problem appropriately.  Both the title (\"SMART\") and the opening paragraph describes the \u201cdata elements\u201d of protocols, implying that the authors are aiming for machine-readable protocols, but that is not what the manuscript is about.  Rather, they are laying out essential elements of protocols in the form of a check list.  Why is it called \u201cSMART\u201d?   \n\r\nIn the discussion, the authors make it clear why protocols are different than a methods section, but that is not made clear in the introduction.  Why was a check list approach taken?  Why aren\u2019t existing checklists-several of which are mentioned in the introduction-not adequate?\n\r\nSee item 2 in the Experimental design section for suggestions on how to improve the introduction.\n\r\n3)  Literature well referenced & relevant.  \n\r\nOverall yes.  Other initiatives and previous approaches to improving protocol reporting like KEfED, and process specification language should be discussed and referenced\r\n.  \r\n4)  Structure conforms to PeerJ standards, discipline norm, or improved for clarity.\n\r\nYes\n\r\n5)  Figures are relevant, high quality, well labelled & described.\n\r\nWay too many figures, a lot of which are unnecessary.  Almost every figure needs a far more complete legend. Figures 2-8 reporting results from a survey of 19 domain experts are interesting but do not further the author's arguments or claims. \n\r\nThe actual Smart protocol elements would be better presented in a single table, rather than 21 separate tables, and should each include a good example and a bad example.  The complete table should include things such as the percentage of review protocols that included an 'Application of the protocol' section (for example). More detail can be provided in the text, but the way they are presented now is confusing.  \n\r\nThey need to present data about how each part of their checklist is currently represented in the protocols they have reviewed, the author instructions, and the experts. \n\r\nTable 6:  Why is AR relevant?  What is the difference between Suggested and Optional?  More information needs to be provided.\n\r\nIt looks like some elements, e.g., Description of sample tested are not even considered (NC)  in most guidelines.  If it isn\u2019t there, how did it end up in this list? As will be detailed in the next section, the methods are under-specified (which is ironic given that this manuscript is about better reporting of methods).\n\r\n6)  Raw data supplied.\n\r\nThe authors provide access to the protocols analyzed via a GitHub repository. Access to data and code is available on github but it needs to be archived via zenodo (or another repository).\n\r\nThe current GitHub repository doesn\u2019t aline exactly with the data presented in Table 2.  The Nature Protocols are labeled inconsistently across the two (no mention of Nature in the Git Hub repository).  The Molecular Cloning protocols are not referenced in Table 2;  the non-polished protocols from CIAT are not in GitHub.\n\r\nI see a list of instructions to authors, but I don\u2019t see that they have been gathered and made available as a data set.  As instructions to authors change, it would be good to create a stable data set from the versions looked at.\n\r\nA note on references here: shortened URLs are not acceptable for citation as there are no persistence guarantees (eg. line 511, 522). The citation on 522 should be given a zenodo DOI, and cited accordingly. Within scope:\n\r\nYes\n\r\n2. Research question well defined:\r\nNeeds improvement. The research question is clear to a domain expert and is extremely relevant and meaningful but is not sufficiently articulated in the paper. A simple restructuring of the argument of the paper will make it much clearer. Something like the following could work. \"Reporting of research protocols is inconsistent. Despite this variability, we wanted to know if there were elements common across protocols. We want to use those elements as the basis for a set of suggestions for reporting protocols. In our analysis we found a common set of elements that we have used to create a practical checklist to help researchers when they report their protocols.\u201d\n\r\n3. High technical and ethical standard\n\r\nAs the study involved human subjects who were surveyed to produce data, a statement about whether or not this was reviewed by an appropriate IRB board should be included.  Although surveys may be exempt, a quick review of on-line materials suggests:  \u201cMany survey projects are eligible for exemption.\u00a0 However, the determination of exempt status (and the type of review that applies) rests with the IRB or with an administration official named by your institution. The determination does not rest with the investigator.\u00a0\u201c\n\r\n4. Methods described with sufficient detail.\n\r\nNeeds improvement. The authors describe what was done without providing sufficient detail into how the checklist was actually generated from those steps. The authors repeatedly say that they analysed sources, but it is not at all clear what that entailed. There are a number of black boxes that need to be fleshed out. What were the criteria for including elements on the checklist (where there any)? What were exclusion criteria? Are there examples of elements that were considered but eventually dropped? 18 elements is very large, if you have to reduce the checklist to 10 elements what would they be? The resulting checklist is presented as is, which is fine, but the reasons given for inclusion of certain elements while practical, often do not have any obvious grounding the the various documents that were analyzed. Exact replication is not expected from this kind of work, but the authors need to report more thoroughly the links between their input documents and the elements they propose (see comments on Basic Reporting 4). 1. Rationale and benefit to the literature is clearly stated.  See item 2 above. Benefit not explicitly stated, but the corpus of documents analyzed and the resulting checklist are major contributions in their own right.  But if we have so many of these already and the reporting is still substandard, then why is adding yet another one going to solve the problem? \n\r\nValidity:  It doesn\u2019t look like there was any attempt to balance the types of protocols or the domains covered.  The list of topics presented for the protocols does not match the expertise of the domain experts.  Also doesn\u2019t look like there was any attempt to validate the results with specific domains that may have not been represented in the expert groups.\n\r\n2.  Statistics:\n\r\nNeeds improvement. No statistics are reported. Given the number of protocols reviewed, it should be possible to give estimates on the portion of the 'population' of protocols that include certain elements, even if only for the domains investigated. The link to the corpus of protocols is not obvious and should be highlighted (it appears as if it were another publication when it is not).\n\r\n3. Conclusions:. \r\nNeeds improvement. The conclusions section is not a conclusion but starts to delve into additional recommendations which either need to be cut, or need to be developed as additional sections. Questions of licensing (as well as patent vs copyright) are critical and if the review of the author instructions shows that no consideration has been made by journals then that is a reportable finding that should be highlighted! While we agree completely that protocols should be required to be reported (they should be in the paper not the supplement! or perhaps published separately and linked), the authors should cite literature related to replication and and reproducibility issues (since direct evidence that poor protocol documentation is the cause of this is still hard to come by) in support of their claims. In addition we would very much contest the idea the the protocol is treated just as any other publication, in the sense that only those protocols that are published are treated as such -- most protocols are not published at all (!) and methods sections do not count. Discussion of any plans to promulgate the checklist for testing whether it improves reproducibility would be much appreciated.  Again, if we already have a multiplicity of check lists, guidelines, instructions to authors, ontologies, data models etc., then why is adding yet another one going to help?  How will this get adopted?  \n\r\n3. Speculation: \n\r\nOK The authors are correct that it is time to treat protocols in a more standard and machine-friendly way and the authors have done a thorough review of the existing practices for reporting protocols in a subset of the life sciences and in that sense is a vital contribution. That said, the paper needs improvement so that it can more clearly communicate how the checklist was developed (specifically a quantification of how the elements included are currently represented across the corpus of protocols), and so that the rationale and motivation are clear to readers who are not also working directly on the problem of protocols.  Discussing why this approach is going to help when all others have not is also necessary.\n\n\r\nThis review was performed by Tom Gillespie, a PhD student working under the supervision of Dr. Maryann Martone.

More extensive referencing needs to be provided, for example, concerning the description of catalytic mechanism of the condensing enzyme Pks13 and the work on phosphopantetheinyl (P-pant) transferase characterization and function in Mtb. The major focus of the paper is on the conformational changes occurring at the C-terminal extremity of this fragment with a possible link to the activation state of the enzyme. The crystallized fragment represents approximately one third of the AT domain, for which a structure has been published by Bergeret and colleagues (JBC 2012). All the classical methods leading to structure determination have been described in details. The insert was cloned into a pET28 vector, transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, purified following a three-steps procedure, and then crystallized.\n\r\nMajor points\r\n1-\tThere is no information on how this protein fragment has been selected.\r\n2-\tThe use of the 4\u2019-phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp from B. subtilis is not justified as modification occurs onto the ACP domain and not onto the AT domain, the subject of this work. Please explain\r\n3-\tThe authors should justify the use of selenomethionine labeled protein considering that the X-ray structure of the full-length AT domain has been published (PDB code 3TZZ). The Pks13 AT domain extends from amino acid 712 to amino acid 1035. The X-ray structure of a Pks13 fragment encompassing the full-length AT domain (amino-acid positions 597 to 1059) has previously been described (Bergeret et al. JBC 2012). Here, the crystallized fragment starts at position 717 and ends at position 826, in the middle of helix \u03b111.\n\r\nMajor point\r\nOne structural feature of the full-length AT domain is the presence of a six-stranded \u03b2-sheet (\u03b213-\u03b212-\u03b24-\u03b25-\u03b210-\u03b211). Only residues forming the central \u03b2-strand \u03b25 are present in the actual structure, at the C-terminal end. It is thus hard to imagine that the conformational changes observed in this region reflect a change in the activation state of the enzyme rather than a structural artefact arising from the absence of neighboring \u03b2-strands. In the absence of any experimental validation, this is pure speculation in my view.\n\r\nMinor points\r\n1-\tLine 22 \u2013 Wrong reference\r\n2-\tLine 33 \u2013 Sfp from B. subtilis. Mtb also has two PPTases named AcpS and PptT.\r\n3-\tLine 48 \u2013 It seems premature to speculate on the orientation of the C-terminal helix considering that it is truncated.\r\n4-\tLine 96 and 111 \u2013 Missing \u00b0 and/or \u00c5\r\n5-\tLine 111 and table 2 \u2013 Space group R32:H ?\r\n6-\tReference section with numbering issues\r\n7-\tFigure 1 \u2013 Missing information on amino-acid positions, schematic representation in the legend\r\n8-\tFigure 2 \u2013 A structure-based sequence alignment with 3TZZ would be greatly appreciated. Also, indicate secondary structure elements on both sequence alignment and structure representation.\r\n9-\tFigure 3 \u2013 Legend and figures need to be modified.

Figures are good, although the main difference compared to an existing structure of HC/FA, namely the presence of the electron density for the loop 1261-1268 is not illustrated. Nothing novel in the presented results compared to those already available in the literature, but the experiments have been done well. Data are sound, conclusions well stated, although nothing novel has been presented. The main difference between the structures described here, namely the visibility of the loop 1261-1268 in HC/FA, is of only limited interest, since conformations of flexible loops, even those involved in biologically relevant interactions, are not very illuminating unless they are seen in a proper context, and not as crystal contacts.

The structural analysis is overall robust, although some additional information about the findings is requested as described in the general comments. The manuscript describes the high resolution crystal structures of the receptor binding domain (Hc) from two botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), Hc/FA and Hc/A1.  These structures can potentially provide insights into the binding specificity of these BoNTs in recognizing particular receptors.  The main new findings include the observation of an Hc/FA loop conformation that was disordered in a previous structure, and the discovery of a disulfide bond in both Hc/FA and Hc/A1 that was not observed in previous structures. The structural data are technically sound.  However,  multiple structures of both Hc/FA and Hc/A1 had been previously determined either for the domains themselves or as part of the whole protein.  Therefore there need to be more discussion of the new scientific insights gained from these structures, in comparison to the previous structures, for both Hc/FA and Hc/A1.\n\r\n1) One of the main new findings is the R1261-R1268 loop conformation in Hc/FA, yet there is no figure showing its electron density or  relating this loop to receptor binding (a role suggested by the authors) by comparing the current structure to previous complex structures.\n\r\n2) In Fig. 1, it will be useful if the authors could show the locations of the disulfide bonds and the R1261-R1268 loop.

For example, there is no mention to the ban of mushroom collection, and how it affected the internal dose due to their consumption. Raw data are shared. A map showing sampling points is missing. The analysis of the radiocaesium concentration in mushrooms in Ukraine and how it may be related to those collected after Fukushima accident is an interesting topic. However, there are only data for three species of mushrooms in Ukraine and none for Japan. The authors use raw and dried mushrooms, this is quite confusing, since a dried mushrooms is not cooked. It would be better to express this in terms of fresh and dry mass. It is not clear if the samples were measured dried or not. The novelty and the importance of the manuscript is very low, as it only gives the mean value of three species of mushrooms from Ukraine. There is no comparison with data from mushrooms collected just after Chernobyl accident. There are many significant references missing. The authors only focused on previous work done mainly by Japanese scientist in that area. In my opinion, this manuscript show only that the authors collected a lot of mushrooms samples and measured them. Therefore my recommendation is rejection.

Can you opine for this in discussion section. "], "3997": ["In general, the manuscript is clearly written. There are some typos and small grammatical issues, which should not be difficult to address. I noted the following:\r\n- \"methodbut\" -> \"method but\"\r\n- \"an robotic\" -> \"a robotic\"\r\n- \"methodswithin\" -> \"methods within\"\r\n- \"methodsin\" -> \"methods in\"\r\n- \"methodscan\" -> \"methods can\"\r\n- \"methodsthat\" -> \"methods that\"\r\n- \"Finally, While\" -> \"while\"\r\n- \"This large overlap could have to do with what the skewed distribution of recognized ..\": \"what\" seems ungrammatical.\n\r\nSome sentences are unclear or confusing, and I suggest the authors clarify them. These are as follows:\r\n- The authors state that \"this ability to have a much more detailed computational view is critical for reproducibility as narrative descriptions of methods are known to be inadequate for this task\". I would think the robotic labs would have to start with the narrative description of experiments for replication. How does one go from this narrative description to computational view? \r\n- The authors state that \"Of the potential 1035 methods only 151 were recognized\". Is 1035 the number of relevant MeSH terms? Earlier in the manuscript, they state there are 1036 relevant MeSH terms.\r\n- \" With the exception of cell culture, the other methods in Table 1 are also comprised of highly automatable tasks.\"  I thought being included in Table 1 meant  the method could be fully automated. What's the specific difficulty with cell cultures? Explain.\r\n\" 26 of these methods are in fact supported by one of these cloud labs, exposing some leakiness  in our procedure.\" The example given is Real-Time PCR. This seems to be a term in MeSH since 2012. Either give a more accurate example or explain the discrepancy.\n\r\nThere are a few figures and tables and their content is adequate. I think Figure 2 can be more effectively presented as a table, and percentages can be added. I think Figure 1 is useful, and something similar for method selection/categorization and for article/method matching would be helpful to guide the reader and tighten up Methods/Results. Currently, these numbers can be hard to follow as narrative text. The authors commendably provide the data and the code for their experiments.\n\r\nSince method identification (a named entity recognition task) is core to the study, I think it would be useful to provide some background for research in this area. Currently, only towards the end of the Discussion section, this particular task is mentioned and very briefly. A more detailed discussion early in the paper would be more informative and situate this study better. The notion of automatically reproducing basic research with robots is an intriguing idea that is being increasingly recognized and an investigation of how much of current research can be automated in this manner is timely and meaningful. The authors do a good job of explaining the research goals and providing the context for them. \n\r\nIn general, the methods are described sufficiently and since the data and the code are provided, the methods can be assumed to be replicable.\n\r\nMy main issue with the study is that the method identification approach does not seem powerful enough to make claims about the use of robotic methods. The authors admit this to some extent, stating that their results are likely to underestimate the use of such methods; however, I believe they could have done more with existing, off-the-shelf tools. Much information seems to be lost in mapping steps and also in method identification. I think some expert feedback or use of additional resources would be appropriate. \n\r\nFor example, 71 of 107 methods identified are identified in MeSH (which is a good starting point), the rest (36) seems like a significant proportion to just ignore.Why not try to use other vocabularies/ontologies for these 36 or just generate term lists, since the annotator basically performs simple string matching?  For example, OBI (ontology of biomedical investigations) comes to mind as a good candidate. Since the paper is mainly interested in assessing the coverage (and not in only automatic method identification), such interventions would be justified.Some further discussion of these 36 methods and how 71 methods identified in MeSH were mapped to 59 concepts would also be helpful (am I right to assume some methods map to the same MeSH concept?). \n\r\nIt is also not clear to me whether the authors tried using MeSH identifiers used for indexing articles in PubMed. I would think this would be the easiest way of answering their core question. Checking a few of the articles they considered, I can see that indexing terms for these articles include some method names. Since these indexing terms are assigned by human indexers, it can be considered a gold standard and would potentially alleviate the coverage issues noted for the annotation method the authors used. Do the authors find that these methods are not consistently or fully indexed? If the authors have not considered this, I would strongly suggest that they do. If they did, some explanation is needed regarding why they chose not to report it.\n\r\nThere are existing, broad-coverage biomedical named entity recognition methods such as MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010). Did the authors consider using them, instead of coming up with their own lexicon-based method? They state  (in the Discussion section) that state-of-the-art in process/task detection is low (0.44 F1), but they do not provide the performance for their own method, making it difficult to assess whether the analysis can be strengthened by such off-the-shelf NER tools. Since MetaMap can be easily tailored to run against MeSH specifically, I believe it can strengthen their approach and findings without too much additional effort. Due to the issues I discussed above, I believe the findings are suggestive rather than conclusive. The authors highlight the difficulties in using automated methods for their task in the Discussion section. I think some of suggestions (using MeSH indexing terms, MetaMap, etc.) can be considered to address some of these challenges (in particular, points 1 and 2 on lines 189-191).  However, I believe this paper is still a step in the right direction for understanding the feasibility of such approaches to reproducibility.\n\r\nAs a side note, I think it would still be useful (with the limitations of the approach in mind) to know how many articles (of 1011) were found to contain only robotic methods. This is never clearly stated. ", "The basic reporting standards have been met. I see no issues with the experimental design. Overall:\r\nThis paper nicely describes the problem of scientific reproducibility and how this could be better addressed by automating basic lab methods using robotics, where applicable. The authors demonstrate that in the corpus of papers analyzed, the majority of methods used in the experiments were assays that could be performed by robotic labs. The conclusions are supported by the analysis.\n\r\nOne thing that I think is missing from the discussion is how this work can impact the future of biomedical research. More specifically, now that we know that the majority of research could be performed by robotics, what are some potential ways we could implement this? A discussion of the potential issues would be nice to include, such as the issue of the expense of running robotic machines, ie not every lab could afford to purchase an automated robotic PCR machine, for example. However, this could be potentially addressed with increased collaborations with labs that already own these tools, and have optimized the protocols. This paper could also be used to promote funding agencies to support automated protocols using robotics, to further ensure scientific reproducibility.

", "In their paper entitled \u201cIndicators for the use of Robotic Labs in Biomedical Research: A Literature Analysis,\u201d Groth and Cox argue that the larger issue of reproducibility across life sciences research could be addressed by the use of \u201ccloud labs.\u201d  These new laboratories are built to fully automate certain biological research protocols.  According to the analysis by Groth and Cox, these newly arrived cloud laboratories can automate over 60% of the protocols in a subset of papers within the Elsevier collection.  The authors do not clearly claim that researchers should be using these cloud labs, but they suggest that using them for certain protocols will decrease the number of errors within the field and increase the reliability of scientific research.\n\r\nWhile an intriguing concept, the paper as is does not warrant publication.  At this point it merely points out that certain laboratory methods can be automation, which is obvious to the reader.  To warrant publication, the authors must distinguish methods that can be automated AND effect the scientific conclusion of the paper from methods that merely can be placed on a robot.  This would be a worthwhile publication. Point 1 \u2013 Definitions of terms\n\r\nThe authors must and clarify define various words used throughout the paper.  These include:\n\r\n1.  \"automated\"\r\n2.   A \"task\" vs. \"pipeline.  Where automation is used and helpful, and when something is \"automated\"\r\n3.  A \"robot\" vs. \"robotic lab\".  Robots doing automation are plentiful and prevalent, while cloud labs are not. It's not clear if robots constitute \"automation\" the same way robotic labs do.\r\n4.  Automation of \"technique\" vs. \"analysis.\u201d  For example, 'microscopy' appears as an robotic method, but it is unlikely that all instances of microscopy automated both the image capture and image analysis. Point 2 \u2013 Methods that could be automated do not seem to be the ones causing the reproducibly issues.\n\r\nBefore publication, the authors must break down methods that can and can not be automated, compared to whether these methods are likely to impact the results of the specific paper.  The authors list methods that could be automated by a cloud lab without any examination or discussion of whether automating these methods would have any impact on the final scientific result.  Within these, many methods either provide a binary response, and are quite robust to variation and interpretation, or are merely preparatory and the preparation methods are robust to variation.  For example, PCR is a robust technique that is usually used in a preparative manner, to obtain enough genetic material for a given experiment.  It is difficult to see how outsourcing this method to a CRO would in any way affect the outcome of the primary and important experiment.  The same thing could be said for many of the other methods the authors define as automated.  A stronger paper would refine further and remove these methods from the list of those that could be automated.  Then, a better discussion forms around the methods that can and can not be automated.\n\n\r\nPoint 3 \u2013 How is a fully automated CRO any different than a \u201ccloud lab?\u201d\n\r\nBefore publication, the authors must draw a distinction between the existing, fully automated CROs and a \u201ccloud lab.\u201d  Otherwise, the rest of the paper does not come from a position of strength.  The authors make a very good point that automation and use of CROs can increase the quality of lab research, but they take a na\u00efve approach to the topic.  They are correct that fully automated CROs, or fully automated internal facilities, are the standard for industrial science, where reproducibility is paramount.  Where they fail to convince a reader is how these new \u201cCloud labs\u201d are any different than existing CROs.  For example, Transcriptic is a fully automated laboratory that allows researchers to conduct protocols of their choosing.  In industry, however, it is widely accepted that a CRO is a fully automated laboratory that allows researchers to conduct protocols of their choosing.  \n\n\r\nPoint 4 --  Analysis lacks depth.\n\r\nIt appears the analysis is a simple word count with little post processing.

Although this behavior is not new, but the data is useful for further study the polymorphism in the TMDs. Therefore, I suggest it can be accepted to be published in PeeJChemistry Journals after major revisions with answering the following questions:\n\r\nSome issues to be address:\n\r\n1. Introduction, it is well-known that 2H-NbSe2 is one of the most famous TMDs, where charge density wave \uff08CDW\uff09 in coexistence with superconductivity. And the superconducting transition temperature is around 7.2 K which is the highest Tc among the pristine TMDs. However, the authors state that \"The system NbSe2 has been the subject of many investigations, since it exhibits incommensurate charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity phenomenon below to 4K (Wilson, Disalvo & Mahajan, 1975).\" is obviously wrong. Evidently, the superconductivity can be seen above 4 K in 2H-NbSe2. \n\r\n2. Introduction, up to now, there are innumerable reports on polymorphism in the TMDs by tuning systhesis temperature (such as MoTe2, from ref. 1966 Acta. Cryst. 20 268.), chemical doping (such as Mo1-xNbxTe2 from Ref.  2015, APL Materials 3(4); TaSe2-xTex from Ref. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2015, 112 E1174) or self-intercalation (such as TaxSe2) and so on. The authors should mention these case and make the readers easily understanding. \n\r\n3. There is a lot mistakes and typos in the whole manuscript. The authors should go through it and fix them, such as \"formulaeTX2\" in the introduction, 7x1x1 in line 131, Nb2Se6 in 173 and so on.\n\r\n4. The authors should perform the resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements to check the CDW and superconductivity on these 2H and 3R-Nb1-xSe2 samples, compared with that of the 2H-NbSe2. ", "Numerous language deficiencies are present, (e.g. out-of-place commas, adjectives without corresponding nouns or missing verbs, such as  \"Both have been found stoichiometric;\", etc.) . Methods should be explained in more detail. For example, authors state: \"The mixture was heated between 760-1050 C for 15 days\" Does this mean that the temperature was changed from 760 to 1050 C over a span of 15 days, that several synthesis were performed at different temperatures (each constant during 15 days), or that the temperature was allowed to fluctuate between 760-1050 during that time?  Please clarify. I also cannot tell which conditions gave rise to each of the polytypes, or whether  a mixture wwas obtained and then the specific crystals were picked individually for further study.\n\r\n\" ...then slowly cooled to room temperature. Crystals of appreciable sizes were grown in the cold end of the tube. \" This seems to imply that the cooling was not homogeneous, and a description of the non-homogeneity of the cooling process is therefore needed.\n\r\n\" an approximate ratio of 1:2 for Nb and Se [for 3R-Nb1.085Se2: Nb (at%) = 29,9 and Se (at%) = 70,1]\" Authors should clarify whether the stated ratio is mass or molar ratio. If those are molar ratios, that translates to a 0.85:2  Nb/Se ratio. If those are mass ratios, they translate to a 0.725:2 Nb/Se ratio. In any case those are quite different from the claimed 1.085:2 Nb/Se ratio. \n\r\nSome extra detail is needed for the theoretical computations: please provide (as Supporting information) the DFT energies of all systems, as well as their geometries. I also notice that the formation enthalpy you compute is not the actual enthalpy, but the energy divided by the number of atoms. Why? Also, at what temperature was enthalpy computed? Authors should state that. Why was enthalpy selected rather than free energy? Doesn't CASTEP allow the computation of hessians and vibrational/rotational contributions, ZPE, etc. , and hence the entropy \r\n and Cv/Cp values needed to compute G? in line 56 \" since it exhibits [...] superconductivity phenomenon  below to 4K (Wilson, Disalvo & Mahajan, 1975)\" I guess authors mean \"below 4 K\", but the quoted reference shows Tc as 7.3 K  (in its table 5, page 189)\n\r\nline 74 \"revisited by single crystals \".

Do authors mean instead that as additional (supra-stoichoiometric) Nb is added the 3R polytype becomes energetically favored relative to the 2H?\n\n\n\r\nlines 193-195 \"it is quite clear, that the increase in the additional Nb , induces changes in the pressure of saturated Se vapor above the surface of the growing crystal, and then affects the concentration of selenium vacancies.\" Authors may suspect that, but I am afraid I do not think that is at all clear: did the authors monitor the Se vapor profile above the crystals duting growth? (Is that even technically possible?) I may be misreading, bu it seems to me that authors have only mentioned Nb vacancies before this sentence, and therefore I do not see how they can posit an explanation of the Se vacancies that (apparently) are not reported to be present (an on the next paragraph are stated to not exist \"A free refinement of the occupancy of Se atoms in the three polytypes, leads to a fully occupied sites\") \n\r\nFigure 3 is not immediately readable, as the reader cannot tell whether the points at the upper right of each graph are calculated/experimental points or are a legend instead. Please correct that. I also fail to see a discontinuity around x=0.07, since (apart from the point that may (or not) be a legend, I see no other 2H points, and the 3R points are not discontinuous).\n\r\nThe legends in Figure 4 are barely readable. please correct.\n\r\nThe discussion of the computed stabilities is deficient: from the data in table 2, I compute formation enthalpies also  of - 66.5 kcal/mol for 2H-Nb1.1Se2  and -67.2  kcal/mol for 3R-Nb1.1Se2  (indeed indistiguishable with the computational methods used). The difference between the stoichoiometric compounds is much larger -76.8 kcal/mol for 2H-NbSe2 and 86.5 kcal/mol for 3R-NbSe2. Interesting as enthalpy differences are, stability cannot be directly inferred from that , but requires the computation of free energies.\n\r\nline 252 \"Moreover, the PDOS at EF decreases and upshifts (see Figs.

For eg: the localization of Pne-Cer 34:1 is not prominent in the mantle of C.gigas. Similarly, 34:2 is not abundant in the gill of C.gigas and 36:2 is not expressed in M.edulis.

They claimed that the method will save significant time and minimize the loss of oligonucleotide samples. However, they need to carefully check their accuracy and the affect of HPLC conditions on the standard curve. If they need to construct standard curve very often to get the accurate data, I did not see how this method will save significant time for researchers. \r\n1. They should provide the original HPLC raw data. In addition, in Table 1 and Figure 1, they only performed once for each different sample. They should at least run triplicate samples to validate the repeatability. \r\n2. For Figure 1, they should provide the standard curve equation. More importantly, they should expand their range of standard curves since they used the current standard curve to calculate the OD260 for ODN 1b. Obviously, the peak area of 1690.6 is out of the detection range.\r\n3. To validate their method, they synthesize ODN 1b and 1c and compare the data obtained through the HPLC peak area and the data by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm on a UV-Vis spectrometer. While they only tested one sample for each ODN. They should at least test three samples for each by synthesizing at different scales. In addition, they should also calculate the accuracy to check whether they are in an acceptable range.\r\n4. They claimed that by skipping the UV-Vis spectrometer measurement, they could be able to minimize the loss of oligonucleotide samples. While the volume of samples needed for Nanodrop is around 1-2 \u00b5L. Is this really significant to save this small amount of samples by risking the results may not be that accurate due to the poor quality of the standard curve that was caused by HPLC condition changes? They should explain more here. ", "Fang et al., developed a method to directly measure the concentration of oligonucleotides (ODNs) with the peak area obtained from the HPLC purification process. The authors established a linear correlation curve between the peak area and the absorbance of the same ODNs obtained from UV-Vis spectroscopy at 260 nm. With the correlation graph, the peak area of targeted ODNs could be directly converted to the absorbance at 260 nm. The authors tested three ODNs with different sequences and found the absorbances at 260 nm converted from the peak area aligned well with the ones from both UV-Vis spectrometer and Nanodrop. Overall, it is interesting to quantify the concentration of ODNs during the process of purification and save the step to separately measure it after drying the samples. However, there are several issues the authors need to address before publication:\r\n1. The authors did not specify the mathematic approach they used to calculate the peak area and how accurate the calculation could be, which is quite important to the theory they claimed here.\r\n2. The linear range of this method was not determined. Besides, the author claimed the concentration of the targeted ODNs is too high, the correlation between the peak area and the absorbance at 260 nm may not be linear and a simple solution to that was to collect fraction of the peak and add the datum to the graph. In this case, how accurate the graph can be used to determine the concentration of targeted ODNs with the peak area value in the nonlinear range?\r\n3. There was only one data point for each injection volume and peak area included in Table 1 and Figure 1, and no error bars were included in Figure 1. More replicates need to be added to prove the reproducibility and consistence of the method.\r\n4. The correlation coefficient (such as R2) of the two lines needs to be added in Figure 1.\r\n5. The author mentioned the correlation graph between the peak area and the absorbance needed to be checked occasionally, especially when the column, eluents, or flow rate were changed. How long one correlation graph could be consistent to determine the absorbance of ODNs with the peak area? If all the parameters for the purification process were the same, yet the correlation graph could change, maybe due to day-to-day or sample-to-sample variations, would it be easier to measure the absorbance after drying the sample with UV-Vis spectroscopy?\r\n6. It was indicated for ODN 1b and 1c, the absorbances at 260 nm obtained from the HPLC peak area and the UV spectrometer were quite different (1b is 12.16 and 11.20, while 1c is 16.92 and 15.40, respectively). The authors claimed it was possibly due to the loss between the transfer from HPLC eluent to UV measurements. What is the specific reason for the loss? Besides, does it mean the concentration of targeted ODNs obtained from the peak area would be different from the real final concentration since there was a loss in the process of solvent drying or centrifuge evaporation? How big the difference would be, and which result people should rely on?\r\n7.Proper references need to be added to the introduction section.\r\n8.

From my understanding of the manuscript, you are using the NIST library to identify compounds. However, you only use TMS derivatisation to derivatise your samples for running on the GCxGC-MS. This means you are missing many samples or will be unable to identify them using the NIST library. The prime example is fatty acids. Those greater than C12 in length, in particular. While they can and are routinely TMS derivatised, this is not the gold standard for derivatisation and, therefore, much of this data is missing/lacking from the NIST library. These compounds are rountinely derivatised to make methyl esters and it is the MS data from these that are found in the NIST library. For such as scoping study, it would be better to use LC-MS as derivatisation isn't (always) needed. Unfortunately, not all supplemental data was available to me. There was only jpeg images of 2D scans with no figure legends. Therefore, it was difficult to assess many of the points in the manuscript where it said to look at supplementary data.

However this method will be only useful when one analyte is present in the sample, for example in drugs For the determination of PTX in plasma you will need HPLC.

", "Insufficient background in the area of respiratory protection.  Need to review the literature thoroughly. Test methods are not well understood and are mixed up. Conclusions address research questions. Review of material and testing methods for virus \ufb01ltering performance of face mask and respirator\r\nThis review describes the material and testing methods for face masks and N95 respirators, and their virus \ufb01ltering performance.  The difference in properties of face masks and respirators to reduce/prevent virus transmission has been described.  To address respirator shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic, research on filter material with novel functionalities, new mask designs and decontamination methods have been discussed. \r\nAerosol particles are captured by fibrous filter materials of N95 respirators and face masks.  Inert particles and virus particles are captured by the same mechanisms and literature shows there is no difference in filter efficiency. In the US, neither NIOSH nor FDA requires viral efficiency tests for approval process.  The developments in this area appear to have limited applications. \r\nThe information on face masks including the approval agency and testing requirements is lacking.  Facemask test methods have been mixed up with N95 respirator test methods. The distinction between filter efficiency and OSHA assigned protection factor should be well defined.    \r\nMinor comments:\r\nLines 66-68 \u2013 Recent studies showed COVID-19 transmission by aerosol mode.

Few other names include surgical, isolation, dental, and medical procedure masks. What facemasks are described in the manuscript?  US FDA cleared surgical masks (SMs) are regulated under 21 CFR 878.4040 and they meet certain efficiency for inert particles and biological particles as well as fluid barrier protection standards and standards for Class I or Class II flammability tests. The surgical mask described in the study should be identified. \r\nLines 89 \u2013 \u201csurgical masks\u201d are recommended for protection.  Is this US FDA approved or other agency approved masks?  Different types of masks under the name \u201csurgical masks\u201d are on the market.  The approval standard or agency should be mentioned. FDA surgical mask information can be obtained from reference \u201cGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff Surgical Masks - Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions Document issued on: March 5, 2004 and a correction posted on July 14, 2004.\u201d\r\nSimilarly, 42CFR Part 84 explains NIOSH approval of N95 masks.   \n\r\nLines 113 \u2013 In the US, respirators are certified by the NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84. \r\nLines 143-158 \u2013 Filter efficiency and assigned protection factor have been described. Assigned protection factor (APF) applies to only NIOSH approved respirators not respirators for other countries.  APF is not applicable to surgical masks.  It appears that filter efficiency and APF have been misunderstood and simplified.  Filtration efficiency and APF are not the same.  One cannot simply measure the filtration efficiency and report the APF value.\r\nThe overall performance of a respirator is described by the OSHA assigned protection factor (APF). APF is defined as the workplace level of respiratory protection that a respirator or class of respirators is expected to provide to employees when the employer implements a continuing, effective respiratory protection program as specified by the 29 CFR 1910.134 standard.  APF accounts for factors including filter media, faceseal, valve leakage, fit factor and others.  OSHA assigns these numbers after thoroughly reviewing the available literature including the various analysis by respirator authorities, as well as quantitative analysis of data from workplace protection factor and simulated workplace protection factor studies, comments submitted to the record, and public hearing testimony.  No such considerations exist for surgical masks and APF does not apply to SM.\r\nLines 169 \u2013 Again the test parameters are all mixed up.  N95 respirator filtration test is done at 85 L/min using charge neutralized NaCl aerosol.  Additional tests are needed for certification under a set of test conditions described in 42CFR Part 84.  Face velocity 0.5 to 25 cm/sec is described in the ASTM standard.  These two cannot be mixed up.  This section should be revised.\r\nLines 181-183 \u2013 I assume the size of virus particles refer to physical diameters not MMAD.  \r\nIn the case of N95 respirators, virus particles smaller and larger than the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) (~50 nm [physical diameter] for N95 respirators and most of the surgical masks).  The virus particles are captured up to 95%. \r\nLines 293-303 \u2013 specify if this is a US FDA cleared surgical mask.\r\nLines 328-340 \u2013 For NIOSH certification, N95 respirators should meet the test requirements described in the 42 CFR Part 84 standard.  There is no requirement for the number of filter media layers and the order of hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers. "], "matsci-16": ["The manuscript was written in professional English. The research backgrounds was fully described by using the appropriate references. The contents of the research is in the field of the journal, and the research significance is explained in detail. And the study meets ethical standards. The research in this paper is very meaningful. It has potential application value to imitate fish similar to live fish by using bionics. However, there are still some shortcomings in the research or questions that readers may have. As shown below:\r\n(1) How to evaluate the flexibility of Gelfish, is it reasonable to evaluate only by hardness? In this paper, only the hardness can be used to determine whether the tissue similarity between Gelfish and live fish is correct? I think this is not rigorous. I don't know whether other scholars in previous studies also used hardness to characterize it.\r\nThe hardness value of the ballistic gelatin in the article should be given, is it Shore A? Or something else?\r\n(2) In the process of preparing the sample, the dosage value of de-foaming agent added should be clear, rather than using a few drops to express it.\r\n(3) Whether it is necessary to vacuum defoam the sample during the fabrication process. I don't know how you solved the air bubbles in the prepared sample.

The introduction is focused on biomimicry and modeling as the foundation for this work, though some additional focus on how similar models have been used to make decisions or inform scientific questions may be useful. There is a considerable amount of biomechanics literature on things like using 3D printing to understand form or function of organism teeth, armor, etc, to model how adaptations might be used in the actual organism. Adding this background might expand the applicability of the research.\n\r\nArticle is well structured\n\r\nThis paper is more of a methods paper than one with a self contained hypothesis and results, but the paper has clear objectives and relevant results. Research question is relevant and meaningful. The topic, understanding how to replicate fish structure and materials, is a knowledge gap. The methods for creating the materials and iterations are well described, with detailed description of how each step was completed.\n\r\nAdditional detail is needed for the durometer measurements. Describe how the model and fish were fixed while taking the measurements. Describe how deep the durometer set up is designed to penetrate. While the durometer is a decent way of understanding the material properties, it might be worth while describing why this one was chosen, as opposed to others, like comparing rated elastic modulus, bending or torsion of the full structure, etc. Findings are generally robust. The results of the strike analysis on the Gelfish is somewhat speculative, as it is not compared to a fish response in the paper, though it is modeled off of previous results. If it were compared to a fish, how does the model assist in understanding whether or not the strike is a lethal strike? What characteristics of the strike are the authors looking for? A certain amount of force or deflection? This is discussed a bit in the conclusions, but it is difficult to understand if biofidelity can be achieved without injuring more actual fish. \n\r\nWhile the strike analysis adds value for the potential hydropower industry, I don\u2019t know if the strike analysis adds important conclusions to the results of whether or not the Gelfish has high fidelity as a model. I would recommend strengthening comparisons to the rainbow trout lab trials mentioned in line 562. Throughout this section, compare findings to the expectations of an actual fish.\n\r\nLine 575 \u2013 the paper describes how the Gelfish began to disintegrate after being struck repeatedly. I would guess that a fish would also begin to disintegrate after repeated trauma. A high fidelity model would need to respond to trauma like the fish. In this case, the fact that the skin separated is an important difference, as that would be an unlikely result in the actual fish. I think the paper would benefit from additional focus on describing how the results compare to actual fish in these sections. Overall, I think this a relevant study with useful data toward creating model fish or other marine animals. \n\r\nI would like some additional discussion about the lack of bone structure in the model fish. How does this compare to the way an actual fish behaves? What is the justification for not including some internal structure?\n\r\nErrata:\r\nLine 200: I think plastic storage bag would be better "], "matsci-12": ["-Your introduction needs more relevant and detail information about your project materials.

Further, authors made a good effort explaining their results in the discussion section. However, figures should significantly be improved for reader to fully appreciate the data authors are trying to present. Experimental methodology is easy to follow and provides a good flow to the story. Further, the proposed experimental design allows for the story to be understandable by the audience. The manuscript by Uthairatanakij and colleagues reports on the usage of rice husk (RH) and rice flour (RF) as bio-sorbent materials for the controlled release of methyl salicylate (MeSA). Different incubation periods of MeSA and bio-sorbent promoted absorption of the methyl ester into either RH or RF (>36%). Presence of the methyl ester within either bio-sorbent was corroborated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis by peak overlapping of MeSA within the RF-MeSA and RH-MeSA samples.  Morphology changes observed through scanning-electron micrographs were attributed the absorption of MeSA in both RF and RH. On the other hand, x-ray diffraction patterns of pristine and MeSA encapsulated RF and RH show minimal to no difference. Thermogravimetric profiles of both RF-MeSA and RH-MeSA reveal a significant mass loss (> 40%) at ~155 \u00b0C, indicative of methyl salicylate decomposition. Additionally, it was found that temperature and humidity have a significant impact on desorption of both RF-MeSA and RH-MeSA, parameters particularly relevant for the industrial application of these two bio-sorbent materials. Further, in a moisture free environment both bio-sorbent materials show to significantly delay the ripening of banana fruits. \r\nPublication is recommended after addressing the following suggestions:\r\n-Reviewer recommends authors to revisit the introduction, some important claims have no reference. \r\n-Reword line 49, the idea authors are trying to convey is not clear.\r\n-Verb conjugation in line 77 should be have instead of has.\r\n-The reported data could be better interpreted if authors spend time improving the overall quality of reported figures.\r\n-For example, in figure 2 remove bottom information and leave the magnification only kV values, align the letters with one another. Further, increase magnification to allow reader to appreciate the structural features discussed in the main text. This can be achieved by having a zoom-in smaller figure within each individual SEM image.\r\n -Pore size distribution must be included to further support the absorption findings.\r\n-Figure 3, data is hard to appreciate given the composition of the figure. Color label and combine all data into one figure Combine all data into one figure. Further, provide a control crystallinity pattern of amylose and/or amylopectin molecules. \r\n-Data provided by figure 4 is a very big component of the story, as authors use this technique to guarantee the presence of MeSA within RF and RH. Regardless of the peak positioning discussed in the main text, authors should color label each spectrum for better interpretation of the results. FTIR spectrum of pristine MeSA lacks a stretch at approximately 2900 cm-1. Further, given the overlapping of the spectra, the fingerprint of the MeSA is impossible to interpret. \r\n-Reviewer recommends authors to elaborate on how TGA findings correlate to the absorption data obtained. Further, sample preparation should be revisited to eliminate water loss during the ramping of the temperature. \r\n- Reviewer invites authors to include pictures of the bananas before, during, and after the postharvest testing to visually support your findings.

But the authors do not expect that proteolysis by trypsin alters the active site or its surroundings significantly. Actually, they assume that two small loops of six residues are removed. I think it is not clear whether this is a proof of concept if the protein is not significantly size reduced or its active site is more exposed. In fact, the main finding is that two flexible/exposed loops can be removed without singnificantly loss of POx function.

Instead, we see a number of observations for very complex and less characterized system accompanied by incorrect data treatment, see below. The arrangement of experiment is more or less traditional for corrosion research, based mostly on the measurements of polarization curves. Very important information about the type of carbon steel is absent (the authors report only elemental composition, but do not consider phase composition which is crucial for corrosion behavior) and escape to describe the samples surface pretreatment (which is crucial for kinetics of interfacial processes).\n\r\nThe most dramatic problem is the choice of the inhibitor under study. For practical applications, this mixture can probably work, but it is impossible to consider the mixture of 5 substances in terms of adsorption isotherms. Any of the components is characterized by certain isotherm when adsorbs in the absence of other species. However the adsorption from the mixture is typically competitive, and cannot be considered in any additive manner. The parameter of Langmuir adsorption isotherm has a meaning of surface-adsorbate interaction energy and cannot be extracted from the data for mixtures.\n\r\nFor FTIR experiments, I failed to understand under what conditions these spectra were registered. To consider FTIR information in the context of adsorption from solution, one needs to measure the spectra in situ. The usual problem in this case is the overlap of bands for solute and adsorbate, and there are many specific techniques to separate these contributions, but nothing is written about this principle technical issue. Most probably Fig.8 demonstrate the spectra of the mixture as is, so it can tell us nothing about participation of certain functional groups in adsorption.\n\r\nThere is no indication of solution pH, which is important in respect to protonation constants for acids. The adsorption properties of organic acids and their anions are completely different. All the findings resulting from the treatment of polarization curves are senseless because of the following reasons.\n\r\n(0) There are no linear parts in Tafel plots, so I wonder how the authors extrapolated the anodic and anodic curves in their Tafel plots to obtain I_corr. I can assume that one of the reasons of non-linear behavior is the Ohmic drop because the authors use a huge (5cm^2) electrode, and the currents in rather wide potential intervals are above 1 mA. For any electrochemical experiments, much smaller electrodes must be applied, and Ohmic contribution should be examined from the very beginning.\n\r\n(1) Arrhenius Eq (2) is valid for the rates of particular processes, and cannot be applied to I_corr, which presents combination of at least two (anodic and cathodic) coupled processes. It is very easy to see (Figs 1-3) that the inhibitor effects on cathodic and anodic branches are different, so the contribution in I_corr are also different for solutions of various concentrations.\n\r\n(2) It is impossible to determine the surface coverage from I_corr using Eq. (4) or even from the currents at cathodic and anodic branches because the rates of reactions are not obligatory proportional to adsorbate-free surface. In particular, anodic dissolution includes chloride adsorption step, which can preferentially occur at some active centers. Adsorption of large molecules like carbohydrates does not obligatory suppress the adsorption of low-molecular species participating in corrosion. For hydrogen evolution, the rate can be proportional either to teta, or to teta^2, depending on the nature of the limiting step.\n\r\n(3) It is impossible to apply Langmuir isotherm to high surface coverages (0.69 an even much higher) because this isotherm assumes the absence of lateral interactions in adlayer. These interactions are unavoidable for molecules with any functional groups. It is also impossible to apply Langmuir isotherm to large molecules which tend to poly-layer adsorption. Moreover, before starting with any isotherm one needs to clarify whether the adsorption is reversible or irreversible. Correspondingly, 'adsorption part' is completely mistaken.\n\r\n(4) I can assume that 'local electrolytic cells' mentioned by the authors is the notion related to local galvanic pairs. However this mechanism of corrosion is not universal, it can take place only for strongly inhomogeneous surface and depends on distribution of minor components in the steel sample. In any case, in NaCl solution the basic mechanism is related to chloride, not to any galvanic pairs.\n\r\n(5) The data tabulated by the authors do not allow to determine any quantities with the accuracy presented now (up to five significant digits). What is tabulated for K (three points in Table 4) does not allow to calculate anything even with low accuracy. If the authors consider their mixture as useful for the practical corrosion protection, they should arrange standard corrosion tests instead of measuring polarization curves.\n\r\nIf the authors plan to develop corrosion science and to publish articles, they should start from the very beginning. ", "In this work English is suitable, clear and technically correct. \r\nHowever the introduction is not enough described and does not clearly introduce the innovative aspects of the study and the literature can be more descriptive on the actual background. (The authors shoud be careful when citing the literature with a specific program since sometimes the references can be missing)\r\nThe structure of the article is not good in the results part where no description is given and should be more emphasized, maybe with a joint results and discussion section.\r\nThe number of figures is adequate for the present study and are relevant for the clarity of the paper, however they can be more thoroughly described throughout the text helping the reader to follow the line of the work. In particular figure9 is not described in the text\r\nThe results could be relevant to the work if more elaborated The present study is within the scope of the journal, could be of a particular scientific interest and is quite innovative for the use of synthetic EPS as corrosion inhibitors. \r\nThe aim of the work should be more emphasized in terms of applicability of the inhibitor in the introduction section.\r\nThe experimental part could be better defined. The authors should better clarify the methods used for statistical reproducibility and repeatability. If the authors used the same sample and performed replicated electrochemical analyses, it is possible that the results obtained where not comparable to each other since the analyses induced a change from the original electrochemical conditions and an anomalous variability. If the authors used different samples, they should explicit the number of replicates more clearly in order to have a good data dispersion, a statistical validation and a significance of the measurements. Why did the authors choose a range of temperatures from 25 \u00b0C to 70\u00b0C? Can the authors report it in the experimental section to justify the choice of temperature range?\r\nDo the authors think that 6 hours is enough to define the behavior of the systems in presence of inhibitors? It would be important to justify it.  Did the authors evaluate the Fe release inside the solution to verify the inhibition effect of the polymer? The impact and the novelty of the work is undeniable but the work lacks some rationale in the methodology used. For instance in the section where the authors discussed the properties of synthetic EPS is a good introduction part but is not supported by the results previously described, thus should be moved or both in the introduction and in the methodology section. \r\nThe data provided in the text can be questionable if the Tafel experiments were performed always on the same sample. The analyses changed the interface and the behavior described does not reproduce the actual conditions, inducing an anomalous variability. It would be better perform experiments using for each condition a 'new' sample (3 samples for each condition).\r\nSome parts of the results are missing and are described in the discussion section. I would suggest to join the results and discussion section in order to have a text that results more clear to the reader. In this work the author investigated the role of specific synthetic EPS to be evaluated as corrosion inhibitors for mild steel in an anaerobic chloride-rich environment. The present study is within the scope of the journal, could be of a particular scientific interest and is quite innovative for the use of synthetic complex polymers that can be found in nature. However the work needs more thorough investigations and is not enough elaborated to be published as a scientific article.\r\nI suggest the authors to rewrite the article focusing on the results and discussion section, clearly indicating the results ad describing the trends found and after that trying to justify the data obtained according to the parameters chosen.\r\nIn terms of scientific rigor, the units should always be the same throughout the paper (use K or \u00b0C and not both) "], "matsci-1": ["In this submission, Loy et al. describe the use of a microfluidic assembly approach to produce functionalized siRNA polyplexes. Improving control during the bottom-up manufacturing of polymer-nucleic acid particles is a worthwhile aim that could help solve the issues of batch-to-batch variability and convoluted structure-function relationships that persist. By incorporating sequence-defined oligocations and sequential chip-based assembly steps, the authors have made a nice step toward achieving fully defined polyplex micromanufacturing. The language is clear throughout, appropriate context is provided through referenced literature, and the experimental methods are both appropriate and well-described. Unfortunately, the modularity and adaptability of the system and its components is a bit of a double-edged sword - the many combinations of assembly conditions and components can cause confusion. This could be alleviated by editing some of the figures to improve clarity. The methods chosen by the authors are appropriate, well-described, and well-controlled. The statistical analysis is transparent and thorough. However, there are a few issues with the results and their presentation that hinder interpretation.\n\r\n1) Portions of the results are derived from nanoparticles assembled by loading \u2018core polyplexes\u2019 onto a microfluidic chip for subsequent functionalization (most of the characterization figures). Other results involve nanoparticles generated entirely on a chip from their molecular constituents (e.g. the MTT and RNAi figures). It is not clear without delving deep into the text which data is derived from which assembly paradigm. It is conceivable that different degrees of condensation could affect the ratio of available:embedded cholanic acid binding sites, thereby changing the effective molar ratio of lipid anchors and PEG ligands provided. Ideally, the characterization assays and functional assessments would be done with identical batches of particles. At the very least, the figures and captions should clearly indicate which assembly method was used in each specific case. Without such disambiguation, the results can neither be accurately interpreted nor reproduced. \n\r\n2) Figure 1 is extremely confusing. It should be redrawn with descriptive labels in the figure itself instead of the caption only. Many of the acronyms used are only explained much later in the text. The rationale for including LA and LAE in the study is not discussed until Line 474, nearly halfway through the manuscript. Abbreviations like DP48F are not immediately obvious. Figure 1B should be changed to clarify that it illustrates two different assembly schemes. It also lists \u201cShell-ligand\u201d where everywhere else it is called \u201cLipid anchor-ligand\u201d. The abstract refers to optimized PEG lengths of 36, but the methods and Figure 1 refer only to 12, 24, 48, etc. It is not clarified until much later that this sum includes both the lipid anchor and PEG ligand. An unambiguous system should be adopted early and used consistently throughout. Fig 1C & D could be moved elsewhere in the text, perhaps nearer to the sections describing the results using the CON assembly system. The adequate sample sizes and acceptable variability of the data enable robust statistical comparison. The trends identified by the authors are generally supported by the results. A few additional controls would strengthen some of the structure-function relationships identified.\n\r\n3) It should be confirmed that the physicochemical characterizations are performed on stabilized and equilibrated particles. If size and charge continue to change over time, comparisons between samples are less reliable. \n\r\n4) It is not stated whether the 500 ng dose/well was optimized. With zero toxicity observed in most conditions, it would be interesting to see a dose escalation test. Not only would this perhaps enable more robust gene silencing, but it would elucidate any differences in cytotoxicity between formulations. It would also be nice to see a validation of FA activity following microfluidic assembly.\n\r\n5) The authors should speculate on the reasons a U-shape effect is observed in gene silencing relative to PEG ligand length. Minor Issues:\r\n- A MALDI analysis of the CO starting material could help validate its synthesis and monodispersity.\r\n- Consider representing hydrodynamic diameter as Dz instead of Dh, as it is derived from the intensity-weighted Z-average.\r\n- Figures scales should be adjusted to fit the data (e.g. Figure 2, Figure 3A).\r\n- The asterisks/lines in Figure 5 are ambiguous. Consider using alternate symbols or tick marks to indicate significance between groups.\r\n- The methods provided for the gel shift experiments indicate 4uL of loading dye was used, but the sample volume is not stated.\r\n- Channel heights should be included in Figures S10 and S11\r\n- Cell source is not provided. Are the KB cells derived in-house or obtained commercially?\r\n- Consider using the more-standard PDI instead of pdi\r\n- The role of acetone in the synthesis should be clarified - is it to retard siRNA compaction (line 524) or facilitate lipid anchor deposition (line 476)?\r\n- Consider adding densitometry analysis to the gel results, as the reader is asked to compare relatively minor differences in band intensity\n\n\r\nTypos:\r\nLine 77: _ _\r\nLine 97: oppositional\r\nLine 229: hepes should be capitalized\r\nLine 367: to-scale\r\nLine 464: lipdid\r\nLine 494: and\r\nLine 296/301/305: well(s) is more standard than pocket(s) ", "This manuscript is well written. There is a nice general introduction of the topic and the results section begins with a first section in which the function of the different part of each compound is well explained and made accessible to non-specialist. All important information are given making possible to reproduce the work and possibly to use the described technology. Note that some figures and nomenclature are misleading, and I strongly advise to revise the manuscript to take this into account (see my General comments to the authors). Overall, the experiments are well conducted. My only main concern was about the decorrelation between the siRNA used in the ex vivo study and the reporter monitored. Indeed, it is not clear for me why the authors measure luciferase activity whereas they used an siRNA targeting GFP. Indeed, if measuring luciferase activity, it would have made more sense to treat cells with siRNA targeting Luciferase gene; or if targeting GFP gene, why not measuring GFP fluorescence? This is a minor comment, but it would be great if the authors justify their choice? \r\nMethods section is in general well written and complete. Especially schematic of the microfluidic devices are given as supporting material which is essential for being able to reproduce the results and use the technology. Yet, couple of minor (yet important) information are missing and should be added (see General comments below). The conclusions and explanations proposed are in line with the results obtained from the experiments. Overall, I agree with all the conclusions exposed by the authors. Moreover, when necessary results were confirmed by an independent approach (e.g. Microscopy and FRET; electrophoresis and Ethidium Bromide assay\u2026). In their manuscript, Loy et al present a new class a transfection agent made of three blocks together with the possibility of using microfluidics to generate homogeneous nanoparticles made two to three components and characterized by controlled structure and composition. The originality of these reagents is the use of a lipid layer to self-assemble the particle through non-covalent interaction. Moreover, the authors introduce a microfluidic device allowing for preparing multilayer nanoparticles of controlled size and dispersity made of three different components in a single step. This is an elegant application of microfluidics and I\u2019m pretty supportive to this work. However, prior to accepting this manuscript for being published in PeerJ-Materials Science, I would recommend the following points to be addressed.\n\r\nMajor points\r\n1. Perhaps the biggest issue with this paper is the lack of consistency between the figures and the text regarding compounds naming. For instance, on Line 562-565 the authors talk about LA-DP48F but the reader needs to understand that this corresponds to P60F (12 Eos from LA + 48 Eos from DPF) on the figure. I acknowledge that an explanation is given in Lines 491-493, but still I have been unsure several times about this point. Another example is on line 692 where the authors state that \u201c\u2026reached their base at DP24F\u2026\u201d. Again, the reader has to understand that, if I\u2019m correct, the authors are not talking about the bars labelled P24F, but rather P36F (ie 24 EOs from the PEG-ligand + 12 EOs from the anchor). If my understanding of the discrepancy between the text and the figure is correct, I would definitely ask the authors to change one of them and use a single nomenclature throughout their manuscript and figure.\n\r\n2. I have been confused with the figures (Figure 4A and S15) showing FRET results. Indeed, in the captions, the authors say that \u201cFRET: excites Atto488 (485 nm), measures CY5 (680 nm). This is misleading for me because we do not know (unless digging the information from the Method section) if this set of wavelengths was apply only to FRET or to all the measurement. Therefore, I would propose that the authors up-date the figures and add next to the name of the experiment (e.g. Atto488) the set of wavelengths they used for this particular measurement (in this case \u201cAtto488 (ex./em.; 485-20 nm / 535-25 nm)\u201d).\n\r\n3. The authors mention several times \u201cconventionally prepared core\u201d. Even though, methods section informs that this corresponds to manually prepared nanoparticles, I think it would be wise that clarify this point the first time the sentence is used in the result section (probably line 540).\n\r\nMinor points\r\n1. In general, I wondered how efficient the transfection agents used in this work are with respect to other commercial ones frequently used for cell transfection (e.g. lipofectamine and Fugene). Do the authors have any clue on that? Such a benchmarking might be of great interest for biologist readers and would allow to better justify these new developments.\n\r\n2. Line 94: The authors state that PRINT method has only advantages. If so, why searching for alternatives? It might be useful to cite disadvantages/limitations of PRINT as well.\n\r\n3. Line 360: could the author give the supplier of the fluoro-silane they used?\n\r\n4. Lines 363-364: the authors use a plasma treatment to bind their PDMS device onto glass slides. It is known that the gas conditions as well as the type of plasma cleaner are important as well. Can the authors indicate if the plasma was generated from air or from oxygen? Also, model and supplier of the plasma cleaner should be given.\n\r\n5. Line 517: the authors mention that \u201cadditional efforts\u201d are required in case 25% acetone is used. Could they specify what these efforts correspond to?\n\r\n6. Lines 523-524: acetone was used to retard siRNA compaction. Could the authors shortly explain why this is necessary and how it works?\n\r\n7. Lines 571-572: \u201cCO in HBG with and without 50% acetone\u2026 LA or LAE with and without 50% acetone\u2026 with and without their respective PEG-ligands\u2026\u201d. From this sentence I was expecting 16 conditions to be tested. However, it turns out that only 8 conditions are found on Fig S14. Therefore, either data are missing or the reader should understand \u201cCO combined with LA or LAE with and without 50% acetone\u2026 with and without their respective PEG-ligands\u2026\u201d, in which case the sentence should be corrected.\n\r\n8. On figure S13.A, third panel, the point at 10 mL/hr indicates a size reliably twice higher than the other points. Do the authors have an explanation to propose for this striking behavior?\n\r\n9. Figure S17. It might be useful for a broad readership if the authors could explain how the Ethidium Bromide displacement assay they used works.\n\r\n10. Transfection assessment. I found odd that the authors used an siRNA targeting GFP mRNA and monitor Luciferase activity as a readout. Why not directly quantifying GFP fluorescence or using siRNA targeting Luciferase mRNA? I think an explanation should be given.\n\r\n11. It is argued that Glutamic acids (E) were included in LAE to increase attachment. Yet, this point is not addressed anymore in the final discussion of the article which left the reader with an open question on \u201chow useful was finally the addition of Es\u201d. I would suggest that the authors had a statement on this point in their discussion.\n\r\n12. Line 815: The authors say that T-junction is best for large scale preparation. How about their microfluidics? Could this technology also be used for large scale preparation?\n\r\n13. In the text, or at least in the caption of figure 1, it would be great to explain what HBG stands for and why using this particular buffer.\n\r\nTypos:\r\nLine 123: \u201cfor or for\u201d should read \u201cfor\u201d\r\nLine 675: repeated \u201cin\u201d \r\nCaption Fig. 1: \u201clipdid\u201d should read \u201clipid\u201d "], "ochem-3": ["In this manuscript, the authors described clear and professional English, however, there are some mistakes and deficiencies.\r\n1.line 65: \"chemists studies\"\r\n2.line 29: \"besides\"\r\n3. line 96-99: 12mmol, 10mmol, et al, add spaces for numbers and units, and check the full article.\n\r\nThe authors provide sufficient literature references, and professional article structure, figures, tables.

"], "pchem-20": ["This manuscript reports cryoprotective activities of three human-genome derived IDPs and their truncated peptides for LDH and GST. CD analysis by using D-enantiomeric isoform suggested that FK20 might not interact to GST and not affect the GST's structure during the cryoprotection. FK20 could also successfully cryopreserve two mammalian cell systems. The experimental design is modern and appropriate. I have major difficulties to understand this finding. Details are shown in the following \"General comments.\" 1) It is my doubt thorough the manuscript that the information of the gene (protein) is limited. The gene information supports readers to correctly understand this work. First, it is needed to note the reason why authors used these protein sequences. More than 10% of open reading frames in eukaryotic genomes have been estimated as intrinsically disordered proteins or proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions. Authors should show the intension of choosing the gene from abundant IDPs existing in the human genome in the \"Introduction\" section or the \"Results\" section. Second, it is highly recommended that the accession number, the function (unless it has determined, putative), and the expression patterns (organ, age, stress specificities) of the protein are documented in the text.\n\r\n2) Figure 1. This figure is difficult to understand. What does the green, blue, and magenta bars represent? Although some bars have amino acid sequences above them, they did not fit to the lengths of the corresponding color bars (or each amino acid sequence is a part of the original sequence that was exhibited by a bar?). Are these sequences parts of some proteins? if so, show which part is taken from the original protein.   \n\r\n3) Figures 2, 3, and 5.

Authors should describe the reason why they adopted the extended molecular shield model to their results.

Fig. 1 is very confusing to me - the protein sequence text is not the same length as any of the coloured bars, making it difficult for me to tell which sequence corresponds to what bar. PONDR is mentioned in the text on line 185, but I could not find any such plot (Fig. S1 is actually a Uversky plot). The supplemental filenames should be revised to make it clearer which files correspond to Fig. S1 etc. The paper has a considerable amount of interesting data and the use of all-D amino acids is a very clever way to address the molecular shield mechanism of IDPs, and an especially smart way to eliminate the IDP signal in the GST CD studies.\n\r\nI am having some difficulty interpreting Fig. 2C and 2D. Normalized activity is not defined in the Methods and I do not see the calculation in the Excel files. Because of the sigmoidal shape of the LDH cryoprotection curves, using a single protein concentration does not provide an accurate view of the efficiency. I would strongly suggest plotting the normalized activity as PD50 (concentration of protein required to recover 50% of LDH activity) to get a hopefully better view of how these IDPs are working.\n\r\nThe cell cryoprotection data are interesting, but I think they are very out of context in this manuscript. I think the data should be removed, because at this point it is not clear if the protection is due to the protein stabilization effect seen in the in vitro experiments, or due to membrane stabilization. The membrane stabilization is a possibility, because the IDPs were added to the culture media and there is no specific evidence that these peptides are internalized. "], "pchem-19": ["This is a clearly written manuscript that highlights the relevant literature in the introduction. The figures are relevant, clearly labelled and of high quality. There was no raw data supplied, which would be the simulation trajectories and secondary data derived from trajectory analysis. These raw data would take a lot of space and re-analysis would be beyond the scope of this review. The experimental design is evident of original primary research. It is made clear how the research question fills the knowledge gap of understanding how mutations outside the active site of an enzyme can influence the binding affinity of an inhibitor. The Methods are state-of-the art and described with sufficient detail that an expert would be able to replicate the methods. All relevant data have been provided, however no statistical analysis was provided. It should be assessed, if the difference in hydrogen bond occupancy in figure 2 is statistically significant. At least error bars based on confidence intervals should be shown in figure 2 as well as in figure 3. The description of the hydrogen bond results in lines 213, 214 (and elsewhere) should distinguish between thermodynamic and kinetic effects by using the correct terms stable/unstable and inert/labile.\r\nRelevant and clear conclusions are made, which are linked to the research question. However, the discussion lacks depth as pointed out in section 4. The discussion is quite limited in scope. It is completely focussed at the results, without references to the wider literature and comparison with similar computational and/or experimental studies. Furthermore, the discussion should refer to the significance of the finding for the future prospects of OTV as an anti-influenza drug and any implications for future drug discovery. An appreciation that the mutation may affect viral fitness (with references to literature) as well as opportunities for further work should be shown. With regards to viral fitness, the present study may even be extended to include a comparison of the computed binding affinities of the natural sialic acid substrate to the mutant and wild-type enzyme. ", "1.\tThe manuscript is clearly written. Only in the introduction around lines 66-68, I would suggest to use the present tense, as the residues are still located at the described positions, this was not only the case when the structures were reported. 2.\tThe authors report that they performed four independent simulations, with different starting conformations. How were these different starting conformations obtained? \r\n3.\tI am typically not a fan of MM-PBSA calculations, but I laud the authors for the clear description of the methodology. Could they still say something about how the SA term was obtained and (more importantly) why they think a single-trajectory approach is appropriate? This is typically only the case if no conformational changes upon binding are to be expected. However, as the whole manuscript is about conformational changes due to the mutation, it is not unlikely that the indicated sidechains would perform very differently in an apo simulation of the protein? The argumentation that the triple trajectory approach leads to a lot of noise does not make the single-trajectory approach more appropriate. 4.\tAt the end of the introduction, the authors make a rather bold statement that in previous studies the \u2018simulations were too short to reach reliable statistical results\u2019. This may be true, but after such a harsh statement, I would expect that the authors would go out of their way to show proper statistical tests for their analyses. As you have done four independent simulations, you could add error bars to the bar plots of figures 2 and 3. Is the decrease of the secondary structure elements of 12% or the change in the occurrence of hydrogen bonds by 10% or 30% actually statistically relevant?\r\n5.\tFor the free energy differences in table 1, the authors may want to emphasize what the difference in free energy is for an effect of a factor 3-50. This would be between 0.6 and 2.3 kcal/mol. \r\n6.\tThe authors may also want to emphasize that, based on table 1, they predict that the difference in binding affinity is mostly enthalpy driven and not entropy driven. Based on that analysis, it makes sense to focus on direct interactions, such as hydrogen bonds. 7.\tIn what kind of interactions does D151 engage when it is not hydrogen bonded to OTV? \r\n8.\tThe authors may want to spend a few thoughts on how their newly derived knowledge on the mechanism of the I117V mutation can be put to practical use. Do they expect that drugs that rely less on the interactions with E119 and D151 would suffer less from this mutation? Could they give suggestions of such molecules?

Has a docking grid been defined and what was its centroid and size? The findings are valid and relevant. Independent from the fact that a zoo of virtual screening methodologies is published in literature a focus on including synthetic accessibility better into high throughput methods is valuable.

In the introduction, one should add a citation to H.B. Schlegel\u2019s WIREs article (DOI: 10.1002/wcms.34), which gives a good overview over different TS optimization techniques. Furthermore, some of the TS optimization techniques mentioned therein might be worth citing as well \u2013 for sure the one that has been used in the DFT re-optimization using Gaussian should be cited here (not just the Gaussian suite itself). \n\r\nB) The introduction itself could be longer in the sense that the importance for high throughput barrier calculations could be highlighted (kinetic model generation for example). Something like this is written at the bottom of p.5, (below \u201cComparison of xTB barrier estimates and DFT barriers\u201d) and could be also given in the Introduction.\n\r\nC) The color codings should be explained in the figure captions of figures 3 & 4.\n\r\nMinor:\r\na) The abbreviation RMSD-PP is actually never introduced, i.e., that \u201cPP\u201d stands for push-pull. In the same context, I find \u201cGrimme\u2019s RMSD-PP semiempirical tight binding reaction path method\u201d in the abstract too coarse, as there are two components here: \r\nThe path search mechanism based on an atomic RMSD-based bias potential and the underlying electronic structure method, which has been the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method in Grimme\u2019s work as well as this one. It would not harm to be more explicit, like \u201cRMSD-PP in combination with the semiempirical tight-binding method\u2026\u201d, since we could, in principle, also combine RMSD-PP with DFT. \r\nb) It says \u201cGFN-xTB [\u2026] models\u201d in the summary, but the paper reports exclusively GFN2-xTB. Were other methods tested? If not, I would just use GFN2-xTB here as well.\r\nc) The x-axes in Figure 6 and 7 should be more explicit (\u201cDFT barrier\u201d or so).\r\nd)\r\np.1: There is a period after \u201cGrimme\u201d in the introduction that needs to be removed.\r\np.2: \u201chaven\u201d -> \u201chaving\u201d\r\np.4: \u201cTS structures proposed by Zimmerman was further analysed\u201d, change \u201cwas\u201d to \u201cwere\u201d. I consider this paper an important contribution to the computational chemistry community. \r\nA) The \u201c2-4 optimization steps without any bias\u201d on p.1 need to be explained further. How many states are exactly taken or what is the criterion for 2 vs 4 steps. It could be emphasized that this is not a path optimization, but an unconstrained geometry optimization, is that right?\n\r\nB) Is the interpolation (p.2) done in Cartesian coordinates? Depending on how far the next neighbor is, this could be a bad choice, maybe not for the systems in this benchmark here, but for rotating substituents (phenyl for example).\n\r\nC) p.2: \u201cthe endpoints of the IRC are geometry optimized, and these structures checked by the same procedure\u201d. This needs further clarification. Due to the computational cost, I am assuming that this means that the structures are all optimized at the GFN2-xTB level. If so: does one actually ever need the adjacency matrix scheme or couldn\u2019t this reoptimization procedure replace that entirely?\n\r\nD) p.4: the \u201crandom \u2018initial distortion parameter\u2019\u201d needs further explanation. Why can this not be done more deterministic?\n\r\nOptional: \r\nE) Did the authors test their procedure in combination with GFN2-xTB and an implicit solvation model (like GBSA)? This may perform better for some of the charged species \u2013 this is just a suggestion. The authors analyze their data quite well and give explanations for each reaction in the supporting information.\n\r\nA) This is a point that needs further elaboration:\r\nFigure 7 shows promising results (DFT singlepoints on the xTB geometries), but it is not discussed in the text at all. I don\u2019t know why. Here it is also important to note what that means. Are xTB geometries used throughout or only for the TS estimate, it looks like the latter, since the deviations all indicate an overestimation of the barrier. Maybe using xTB geometries (for the minima) could help here. I think this deserves more attention as it might give access to fast screening (a DFT singlepoint is mostly bearable). \n\r\nB) The discussion/methodology around Figure 8 could be elaborated a bit more. Particularly, how are \u201cwrong TS\u201d classified if they fulfill all the 3 criteria? For example, are they higher in energy than the ones presented by Zimmerman, or is there a possibility that they actually found a lower TS?\n\r\nC) The systems are mostly too small for this to be relevant, but the authors should mention that there exists an difference in the included physics: GFN2-xTB contains a London dispersion correction, while the DFT level does not. I understand that for consistency with Zimmerman, a dispersion-devoid model was used. But the authors should clarify that this could expectedly(!) lead to differences between both levels of theory for larger systems. \n\r\nD) Is the tool/workflow available to the community?\n\r\nOptional: \r\nE) For the TS geometries in Figure 5: Did the authors try to compute S^2 expectation values with UB3LYP on both geometries? It would be interesting to know if the DFT geometry is spin-contaminated or if the xTB geometry has related issues (GFN2-xTB always favors low-spin configurations). Maybe a simple S^2 expectation value on both geometries shows something here (maybe not). The manuscript \u201cFast and automatic estimation of transition state structures using tight binding quantum chemical calculations (#50973)\u201d by Rasmussen and Jensen elaborates on an earlier presented reaction path scheme and assesses its performance for transition state structure prediction using a previously presented benchmark set. The manuscript is well written. It needs, however, attention in a couple of aspects. I suggest publication after the addressing the above raised issues. ", "2)\tThank you for providing a repository with data at https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/EPvv68fOTp. The Supporting Information statement indicates that these are \u201cdata resulting from this study\u201d. However, I note that:\r\na)\tOnly reactant and product structures are provided, whereas (approximate) transition state structures are the key data resulting from this study. Would it be possible to include those? Including both the TS geometries obtained with the method and those optimized with DFT would allow other researchers to properly evaluate the work and results. \r\nb)\tIt is not described whether the provided structures are DFT geometries obtained from Zimmerman\u2019s work, or geometries reoptimized with GFN2-xTB by the authors of this work. Please add this important meta-data.\r\nc)\tI note that only 77 reactant structures (*r.xyz) and 91 product structures (*p.xyz) are included in the reactant_product_structures.tar.gz archive. They include also the reactant and product structures for the 5 reactions from Zimmerman\u2019s set that were not used in this study (reactions 94, 95 and 102-105). This means that many reactant and product structures are missing. \n\r\n3)\tThe results for the barrier height prediction are not very clearly presented/quantified. \r\na)\tThe authors state that \u201cthe RMSD-PP barrier is a good approximation for the corresponding DFT barrier for reactions with DFT barrier heights up to about 30 kcal/mol\u201d, but they provide little/no direct quantification of this. They do state \u201cThe correlation between xTB and DFT is considerably better for these reactions.\u201d, so please include a measure for this correlation here. \r\nb)\tThe presentation of Figures 6 and 7 is not optimal. I assumed that the six plots are for the data obtained from the 6 runs, with Runs 1-3 (obtained with parameter set 1) shown on one side, and Runs 4-6 (obtained with parameter set 2) on the other. This is probably the case (as indicated in the text), but the Figure legend itself states: \u201cFigures (a), (d), and (e) correspond to runs 1, 2, and 3\u201d, and it is not clarified what panels b,c,f show. This would be made much clearer by adding labels of \u201cRun 1\u201d etc. above the individual panels. Further, axis titles should be clarified, e.g. \u201cBarrier xTB\u201d --> \u201cBarrier estimate from GFN2-xTB\u201d and \u201cBarrier\u201d --> \u201cDFT Barrier\u201d. Further, the different ranges on the y-axis make visual comparison between runs difficult. Could the same range be employed throughout (e.g. 0-200), perhaps with outliers beyond 200 kcal/mole indicated using arrows?\r\nc)\tThe authors could consider placing the full Figure 6 and 7 in the Supporting Information (in which case point b) above could be ignored), and replacing them with plots for 1 run only, where they can show two plots for each: the total set of reactions as well as the reactions with DFT barriers below 30 kcal/mole only. This may help to better deliver a main message of the paper (\u201cthe RMSD-PP barrier is a good approximation for the corresponding DFT barrier for reactions with DFT barrier heights up to about 30 kcal/mol\u201d, but not/less so for those with higher barriers). This will have the additional benefit of making the labels better readable (as they are currently quite small).\n\n\r\n4)\tThe presentation of the reactions is not very clear / may contain mistakes. \r\na)\tIn the main text, Figures 3 and 4 would be much improved by including standard (electron pushing) arrows to describe the reaction. At least, the following should be added to the legend: \r\n\"Bonds broken in the reaction are indicated in red, bonds formed in blue\". \r\nb)\tTable S2 (and deposited data file reactions.txt) contain several identical reactions, i.e. reactants and products are identical (e.g. 1 and 2; 4,5 and 6; 10, 11, 14). This needs to be corrected. Further, the minus signs indicating atoms with formal negative charge are often difficult to spot. Can they be enlarged, or (ideally) be placed in circles (as in Figure 3)? 5)\tSome further clarification/information on the methods could be added. \r\na)\tI very much appreciate the short description of the RMSD-PP method, so that original paper(s) by Grimme describing the method do not have to be studied in detail. To clarify further how the method works, as relevant to the current manuscript, can you please describe: 1) How are points on the path defined (i.e. the 'distance' between them, and/or 2) how is it defined how many points there are on the full path?\r\nb)\tCould there be a short indication/description of how the k_pull and k_push and alpha values used in the parameter sets were arrived at? Trial-and-error? Based on previous work? 1)\tThe authors correctly describe their method as \u2018fast\u2019 in the title, however, exactly what this means is not described or reported clearly. \r\na)\tTable S5 indicates (for just two reactions) the wall-time required for TS estimation by their procedure, which is impressive. However, no reference is made to this table in the main text, nor is any approximate timing given for TS estimation. I suggest that the authors include somewhere (perhaps even in the abstract), that TS estimation can be obtained \u201cwithin a few minutes on a single CPU\u201d. Where such a statement is added to the text, Table S5 can be referred to. Further, it would be better if the CPU used for the Table S5 timings is described (e.g. speed in GHz, perhaps also type). \r\nb)\tIn the abstract and summary, the authors only describe that \u201cRMSD-PP barrier heights [..] can be estimated at the cost of a single energy minimisation\u201d.  What this means is not very well defined, and is certainly hard to interpret by reading the abstract only. With RMSD-PP barrier height, to the authors mean barrier height estimation/calculation after TS estimation, or the whole procedure to obtain the estimate TS? With \u201csingle energy minimisation\u201d, do the authors refer to a single energy calculation or a single structure optimisation, or the procedure of \"start with the reactants, turn on push/pull potentials, minimize, and check, whether the system falls into products\"? If energy calculation or optimisation, at what level of theory? This statement should be changed/clarified. Rasmussen and Jenssen describe and evaluate a fast and automated procedure to determine transition state structures (TSs) for elementary reactions. The procedure is based on the RMSD-PP method from Grimme, together with his semiempirical tight-binding method GFN2-xTB. The work appears well-designed and conducted, and the methods and results are generally reported clearly and succinctly. I highly commend the authors for their efforts to produce a successful automated method for TS optimization that allows taking full advantage of the speed enhancements possible from Grimme\u2019s methods, and making their code openly available and well-documented. There are, however, several things that should be clarified and some errors/omissions that should be corrected before the work can be accepted (see review sections).\n\r\nThe github repository is well structured and the code is extensively commented, which is highly appreciated. A suggestion: currently, the implementation can only be used with SLURM job scheduler. It would be nice to refactor the implementation to allow running the scripts with other job schedulers or at least directly on a local machine.\n\r\nFinally, minor points regarding textual/language errors and small clarifications are annotated in the attached PDF. I would appreciate if the authors could address these too, to further improve the readability. In my view, it is not particularly useful for the community to make this annotated PDF available online; all main points raised are clearly described in the review text.\n\r\nI hope this review will helpful to improve the presentation of your work.\n\r\nMarc W. van der Kamp "], "pchem-13": ["The hypothesis for the study is not clear based only on the introduction.

Figures 1 and 2. The amino acids being explicitly displayed in Figures 1 and 2 should be labelled accordingly. I have ordered the flawed sections of the experimental design below by priority (1 being highest priority).\r\n1. The authors should run simulations of the apo (i.e. no ligand) pTPI and hTPI. Several comments in the text (see lines 225-227, 236-237, 245-247), make conclusions on what happens to the structure of TPI when the ligand binds. However, since the authors did not simulate the apo TPI structures, they do not have a set of simulations to compare with their ligand-bound simulations. Thus, the conclusions based on those findings cannot be validated.\r\n2. Why do the authors only run 100 ns for each simulation? With the size of the systems, the authors could easily run each to at least 1000 ns. The RMSD plots (Figure 3) suggest that none of the simulations have reached a stable structural conformation with the bound ligand. Instead, the RMSD values continue to increase as the simulation progresses up until the end (100 ns). This suggests the protein-ligand complexes have not reached a stable structure (i.e. converged). Thus, the authors should extend their simulations well beyond 100 ns until the structures reach a stable conformation that the authors can trust and verify.\r\n3. The authors should perform a hydrogen bonding analysis on their simulations. On multiple occasions (Lines 361 and 349) they mention the stabilizing interactions as polar and/or hydrogen bonds, but the authors do not support these statements with the corresponding analysis. The authors should report percent occupancies and lifetimes for any hydrogen bonds relevant to protein-ligand stability.\r\n4. Why was sulfaE chosen as the representative ligand to test? The authors should make this clear. And if there is no obvious reason, the reviewers should run additional simulations to include the other two ligands mentioned from the previous work.\r\n5. It is unclear how many frames/snapshots were used for MM-PBSA calculations for each simulation. Line 210 says that 20 snapshots were used. from each simulation. However, line 217 says that about 2000 conformations were used for MM-PBSA (is this per simulation or total across the four simulations?). If only 20 snapshots were used per simulation, that's only 80 snapshots. So where did the 2000 come from? In my experience, a minimum of 200 frames must be analyzed to get reasonable results from MM-PBSA.\r\n6. At the very least, they authors should explain why they chose not to include entropic calculations in their methods. On lines 338-340, the authors mention the potential effect of entropy on ligand affinity. The authors should calculate the entropy of the systems using snapshots from their simulations to support their conclusion here.\r\n7. Line 143 states that 6000 water molecules were added for each simulation. Was it precisely 6000, or is that an approximation? If it is not exact, the authors should clarify.\r\n8. Line 192. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Did the authors use the linear or non-linear form of the PB equation? And why? The authors should justify the reasoning for their choice. Most of the conclusions drawn from the current data meets the journals standards. However, there are certain areas where conclusions are drawn and/or statements are made that do not have data to back up the claims. These areas have all been highlighted in the comments on the Experimental Design, but I will restate them here for completeness.\r\n1. I am skeptical of the validity of one of the simulations and/or the MM-PBSA results. Specifically, the simulation with sulfaE bound to the hTPI dimer interface. The MM-PBSA results state the average binding free energy is +35.86 kJ/mol. This value suggests the ligand and protein are incompatible and are energetically unfavorable for binding. If that is the case, it would be expected that the ligand should dissociate from the binding pocket of the dimer interface to mitigate this unfavorable bound state. However, the authors make no note or mention of the dynamics of this simulation, or the physical meaning of this energetic unfavorability. The polar solvation term is clearly the leading cause of this energetic instability. However, the authors do not explain why the polar solvation would tend to be so positive for these complexes, and especially so for the hTPI dimer interface simulation. Such a high positive binding free energy suggests 1) something is fundamentally wrong with the simulation, or 2) the MM-PBSA calculation did not use the proper variables to accurately represent the complex. Without seeing the simulations up close, it's difficult to suggest which of these may be the culprit of these poor results. Either way, I'm highly skeptical of these energies as they are being reported.\r\n2. Several comments in the text (see lines 225-227, 236-237, 245-247), make conclusions on what happens to the structure of TPI when the ligand binds. However, since the authors did not simulate the apo TPI structures, they do not have a set of simulations to compare with their ligand-bound simulations. Thus, the conclusions based on those findings cannot be validated.\r\n3. The RMSD plots (Figure 3) suggest that none of the simulations have reached a stable structural conformation with the bound ligand. Instead, the RMSD values continue to increase as the simulation progresses up until the end (100 ns). This suggests the protein-ligand complexes have not reached a stable structure (i.e. converged). Thus, the authors should extend their simulations well beyond 100 ns until the structures reach a stable conformation that the authors can trust and verify.\r\n4. On multiple occasions (Lines 361 and 349) mention the stabilizing interactions as polar and/or hydrogen bonds, but the authors do not support these statements with the corresponding analysis. The authors should report percent occupancies and lifetimes for any hydrogen bonds relevant to protein-ligand stability.\r\n5. On lines 338-340, the authors mention the potential effect of entropy on ligand affinity. The authors should calculate the entropy of the systems using snapshots from their simulations to support their conclusion here. This study is interesting and has the potential to be intriguing to many people in the field. I believe the research has high impact capability. However, I believe the manuscript currently is not ready to be accepted because it has a number of flaws. The experimental design is lacking many important steps that would help make the project complete. Additionally, several of the conclusions are stated without proper evidence to support them. Hopefully, the suggestions I have given seem reasonable and you are able to perform the necessary revisions to complete the manuscript. ", "1. Professional English is used throughout the manuscript.

The focus of the work is to explore the interactions between pTPI/hTPI and sulfonamides using docking and MD simulations. There is no experimental evidence that 'sulfonamides' in general and in particular the 'antimalarial sulfonamides' used in the work can inhibit or bind to TPI. Without such premise, using modeling to explore interactions quite frankly does not contribute any new useful knowledge or hypothesis.\n\r\nIf the compounds were being consider as potential inhibitors of TPI, it would be better to use modeling and/or experimental tools to compare them with known inhibitors and non-inhibitors. "], "pchem-11": ["This paper cites only 18 references even though it addresses a rather 'classic' problem using rather 'classic' methods. 6 of the 18 references correspond to potential energy methods which are not the point of this study. Comparison to performance of other optimization runs published in design papers in the literature is lacking entirely. As such, I am skeptical about the scholarship level of this manuscript. For example, Geerlings and co-workers published some best first search molecular design results a couple of years ago where they also found surprisingly rapid convergence in chemical space. The authors offer little to no context regarding this and other related work in the field. All other boxes (English/Structure/self-contained) check. I see two problems with this manuscript. First, the research question is, to the best of my understanding, not entirely well defined. Typically, when performing molecular design, some target property value should be given, and the optimisation algorithm has to search chemical space in order to minimise deviation from target property. This is what the authors do for the absorbance. It is less clear to the reader what is the actually target in their 'Graph-based approach' section. If it is just the Tanimoto similarity I do not really understand the point since the target is then known already and a simple greedy best first search algorithm should trivially lead to the result in (practically) no time. Or is this interesting because only a GA should be used? In any case, I do not think that this is sufficiently well explained. \r\nSecondly, the example target values for the absorbance (200, 400, and 600 nm) seem ad hoc, and it is hard to decipher for the reader how 'hard' they really are. If the absorbance distribution of their molecular space had, for example, peaks at those three values, it should be relatively easy to rapidly find examples that get close. As such, it is not clear how such a hidden bias might have affected the results and the conclusions drawn. I think that a distribution plot of some representative sub-sample should be shown, and the authors should also include target values which lie outside of that distribution, in order to see if their conclusions also hold for the extremes.\r\nAll other boxes (primary research/rigorous investigation/methods) check. The conclusions should be adapted in response to the changes requested before. All other boxes check. This is an interesting study with interesting findings. There are some points which should be adressed, but I think that it can be easily done. It might also be worthwhile to include some speculations in how far the conclusions depend on the choice of GA as an optimization algorithm, and how they could change if other algorithms were used.

The value of the study results from the high number of measured and analyzed parameters (data related to the accuracy of the movements execution technique, body composition, biochemical indicators of blood and analysis of the associations between these independent, studied variables). Laboratory investigations are the strong point of this study. The research is useful for the scientific direction of the training process for the targeted athlete category. \n\r\nThe reviewed work is valuable and useful to those working in the field of sports (especially due to detailed laboratory explorations) and may be published after a few minor revisions. I think it would be useful to formulate working hypotheses (at the end of the introduction), to which the results from the tables and graphs should be reported.\n\r\nPlease specify the (MMA) sports activity experience of the 2 groups studied and some data related to the height and weight of these athletes (average and standard deviation).\n\r\nCould you indicate the 2-month interval in which you performed the experiment (months and year)?\n\r\nIn what stage of training (general physical training, pre-competitive or competitive training) were the investigated fighters?\n\r\nPlease specify the type of study performed (longitudinal or cross-sectional study). Why didn't you compare the results between the 2 groups (A and B as independent samples) by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test? I noticed that you have a large volume of analyzed data anyway (and these additional comparisons would have doubled the number of tables), but it would be advisable to make these comparisons perhaps in another paper, for a complete view of your results. However, this does not reduce the value of the study.\n\r\nTables 2-5 show the results of the Friedman-Anova test and compare the differences between the 3 tests (T1 - initial, T2 - intermediate - one month and T3 - final - 2 months). It should result in 3 data pairs with 3 values of Z and the associated significance thresholds: T1-T2, T1-T3 and T2-T3. Only two pairs appear in all tables, probably T1-T2 and T2-T3. Could you include the missing pair? \n\r\nYou used SPSS software, so the effect size value (expressed by Kendall W) might have been calculated if this option was checked. It would provide additional support in arguing for the significance of the differences obtained. It's just a remark, the study is well-argued enough even without this statistical indicator.\n\r\nIn Table 4, for the BF indicator (body fat %) there are big differences between groups A and B, right from the initial testing.

They found that the cyclocytidine HCl decreased the synthesis of HBV rcDNA, and they hypothesize than this might be due to the inhibition of viral DNA polymerase activity.\n\r\nGeneral Comments\n\r\nThis is an interesting, straight forward work, with clear aims and an adequate experimental design. However, a number of observations should be answered by the authors before the manuscript is suited for publication.\n\r\nA number of grammatical and language style mistakes were found throughout the manuscript. Thus, we suggest a deep review of English language.\n\r\nThe main deficiency of the present work is the lack of statistical analysis of data presented.  \n\r\nIntroduction\n\r\nThe authors wrote that \u201cCurrent anti-HBV agents primarily target the process of rcDNA synthesis, but cannot inhibit or destroy cccDNA formation\u201d. It would be important to describe what is the actual effect of the mentioned anti-HBV agents, and why there is a need to look for new anti-viral agents.\n\r\nAlthough cyclocytidine HCL is the agent evaluated in this work, the information provided about it in the Introduction section is very scarce, it is not clear why the authors selected this particular prodrug. Please write a clear justification to study cyclocytidine HCL as a potential anti-viral agent. Materials and Methods\n\r\nBrand names of relevant reagents are only cited in a few of them.

The authors declare that \u201c20 \u00b5M cyclocytidine HCl appeared to moderately decrease rcDNA production\u201d, \u201cmoderately decrease\u201d is inconclusive, the authors must show a statistical analysis to support this observation.\n\r\nIn lines 145-146, the authors describe that \u201c\u2026the extended time (4 days) of treatment decreased the production of total core DNA that might result from cytotoxicity (Figure 3C, lane 3).\u201d  It would be interesting to demonstrate that the effect on core DNA production is actually due to cytotoxicity, a simple assay incubating cells with 20 \u00b5M cyclocytidine HCl at different time points (including 2 and 4 days) evaluating cell viability with the MTT would provide a clear answer to this point.\n\r\nSub-section \u201cCyclocytidine HCl inhibited the synthesis of the positive strand of rcDNA\u201d. Although the effect on rcDNA synthesis seems to be clear, a statistical analysis is needed to support the findings.\n\r\nFigures\n\r\nFigure 1. There is a number of inconsistencies in Figure 1 capture. For instance, the authors indicate \u201c(left) Relaxed circular (rc) DNA.\u201d , however there is no need for indicating \u201cleft\u201d since the title \u201cRelaxed circular DNA\u201d is written.

There is no mention of this in the methods section. Results:\r\n\u2022\tS3.1: How dit 663 samples result in 730 injections; were 67 QCs injected?\r\n\u2022\tS3.1: Principle component analysis was abbreviated as PCA in line 131. This abbreviation should be used in line 162.\n\r\n\u2022\tS3.2: The first 2 sentences of this section should be switched (lines 167-169).\r\n\u2022\tS3.2: Was the PLSDA not used as well?\r\n\u2022\tS3.2: The terminology (males vs boys; females vs girls) can cause some confusion. For example, do the authors refer to females as an entirety in line 179? In such case, they should clarify and denote this as \"female/girls\". If not, the terminology is correct as is. Also consider the same question for \u201cmales\u201d in line 181.\r\n\u2022\tS3.2: Can the authors elaborate on what other type of environmental factors they refer to in line 196?\n\r\nMajor comments:\r\nThe data interpretation is scattered between Sections 3 and 4, making this somewhat repetitive, with a lot of \u2018jumping between sex vs gender trends\u2019. The Results section should simply list the results only (what the data showed based on what stats they did), without ANY explanations provided for any of the metabolic changes. This would be Sections 3.1\u20133.3 only, which still need to be re-evaluated/adapted to remove any explanations (e.g. lines 194\u2013197; 226\u2013227). In Sections 3.4\u20133.5 the authors started to explain some of their findings (e.g. lines 238\u2013255). This should all form part of the Discussion section; hence these type of discussions need to be moved to/combined with the Discussion section. Consider the following feedback for all of these sections in light of such a restructure:\n\r\n\u2022\tS3.4: The first 2 sentences (lines 231\u2013234) are redundant and repetitive. It should be removed and/or only mentioned in the Results section.\r\n\u2022\tS3.4: (line 242) The authors can exclude either Fig 4 or Table 2 from the manuscript, since these both give the exact same information \u2014 the reader would not miss out on any NEW information in the absence of one of these. Since Table 2 is easier to interpret for a reader who doesn\u2019t understand heat maps, I would recommend removing Fig 4. (This Pathway Analysis part can remain part of the Results section, leaving the rest of this interpretation/discussion for Section 4) \u2014 Combine S3.4 interpretations with the discussion; combine the results parts with Section 3.\n\r\n\u2022\tSection 3.5 is somewhat repetitive of Sections 3.3 (last paragraph) and 3.4; this section should rather be combined with the rest of the Discussion, to expand on what is stated there. This way, the authors will not need to repeat the mentions of previous sections before providing and/or discussing the key variation further.\r\n\u2022\tS3.5: Why would this trend in lines 268-272 occur? \r\n\u2022\tS3.5: Did pantothenate/VitB5 (lines 273-276) decrease with age? Do we then need less B5 as we age?\r\n\u2022\tS3.5: Why would this trend in lines 283-287 occur?\n\r\n\u2022\tGeneral: The authors should consider each of their differentiating metabolites/pathways (for sex and age) separately and interpret these on an individual level. For example, \u201c\u2026steroid hormone biosynthesis was found to be age dependent, although this difference was found in girls rather than boys, partly resulting from later sexual development in boys\u201d (lines 225-227). Here, the authors give an (although very brief/superficial) EXPLANATION of the increased steroid hormone biosynthesis observed. There is no in-depth or even a generalised explanation, such as above, for their statement in lines 219-222: \u201cIn the children population, the metabolites involved in (1) histidine metabolism, (2) riboflavin metabolism, (3) pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis and (4) fatty acid biosynthesis were found to change with age in both boys and girls\u201d; why would these different pathways (labelled 1\u20134 only for the purpose of my feedback) be affected? The \u201cchanges\u201d referred to, were these up- or down-regulated? Why? The explanation provided in lines 277-282 is also very nice and it makes sense for the reader. Such explanations for all of their observed trends would enhance the article\u2019s usefulness and impact significantly.\n\r\nDiscussion:\r\n\u2022\tS4.1: Why do females have higher Trp levels (line 304)?\r\n\u2022\tS4.1: The authors mention that uric acid is higher in boys than girls (line 315), and this contributes to a higher prevalence of hyperuricemia. Can they, however, speculate on WHY this would be the case (physiology/biochemistry)?\n\r\n\u2022\tIn S4.1 the authors state that Trp is likely higher in girls (line 303/304, therefore contributing to higher levels of its catabolism products (5-OH-indoleacetic acid). Yet, in S4.3 (lines 368\u2013369), they state that Trp-metabolites (5-methoxytryptophan) were higher in boys. Similarly, line 321 higher acylcarnitine levels in males, but in line 402, these are reported as higher in girls\u2026 These statements seem in contrast with each other\u2026\n\r\n\u2022\tS4.3: Why would arachidonic acid metabolites need to be higher in females (lines 409\u2013412), is there a physiological need perhaps?\r\n\u2022\tS4.3: With increased 8-OH-7-methylguanine detected in men (line 414\u2013420), does this mean men is more prone to develop tumors/cancer?\n\r\n\u2022\tGeneral: The authors need to include more reasoning (why?) in their discussion(s). Simply stating that a compound is increased in males vs females and that this corresponds with previous results isn\u2019t sufficient. [Please also see my \u2018general comment\u2019 for Sections 3 \u2014 these explanations can be included/moved to the discussion instead.] Such explanations for all of their observed trends would enhance the article\u2019s usefulness and impact significantly.

How are the MS/MS scores calculated? Are these the \"scores\" from the table S1? It is important to know which reference MS\u00b2 spectra from the public database have been used (there are often several spectra per compound), and the instrument with which they were acquired should be specified. Figure S3 gives information on only a few compounds and it is difficult to compare spectra based on images alone. For important compounds, it is necessary to acquire reference MS\u00b2 spectra in the laboratory with authentic standards. \r\nIn Table S1, some metabolites are detected in other forms than the protonated one. Some like Tyrosyl-valine or glutamine should be detected in the protonated form. Is there an explanation for this?

They found miR-34a-5p was decreased in SK-RG (KSHV-infected SH-SY5Y) cells. Increasing miR-34a-5p in SK-RG cells reduced its proliferation, migration, which could be associated with decrease of CDKs and MMPs. In addition, overexpression of c-fos (one target of miR-34a-5p) restored miR-34a-5p mimic-mediated decrease of proliferation, migration, CDKs, MMPs, and KSHV gene expression. In vivo, miR-34a-5p agomir reduced tumor formation. Generally speaking, this study is well-organized and well-designed. Following are the comments:\r\n1. Language editing is needed. The grammatical errors significantly decreased the accuracy of the information that the authors wanted to deliver.\r\n2. I have concern about the efficiency of rKSHV.219 infection. From Figure 1A, the successfully infected cells should carry GFP. However, from their data, the infection efficiency is not 100%. In this case, sorting the GFP positive cells is needed. Otherwise, wild type SH-SY5Y cells will be mixed into the SK-RG cells. Thus, the results will be less reliable. \r\n3. The authors should at least label out the most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs in their volcano plot. Otherwise, why bother to show it? \r\n4. I see under subhead 3.2 the authors wanted to study cell cycle. Then, cell cycle analysis would be recommended. Evidence directly shows that increase of miR-34a-5p leads to cell cycle arrest is needed.\r\n5. Another issue of this study is the protein changes in western blot are not significant enough to convince people that those proteins were truly increased or decreased. This happened in Figure 3E-F, Figure 5F, and Figure 6E.\r\n6. Did the authors run a power analysis to confirm the number of mice they needed for each treatment for their xenograft model?\r\n7. Have the authors compared the c-fos expression in their SH-SY5Y and SK-RG cells? This is important.\r\n8. It is unknow the regulatory pattern of miR-34a-5p, c-fos, and KSHV.

Choosing cutoff points using the 70% of database, and training the multivariate model with the rest 30% would have been understandable but it is not the procedure that the authors have followed\r\n- Authors declare that \"Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of each tumor marker on CRC metastasis in the primary cohort, and the cutoff values of each tumor marker were obtained.\" This point must be clarify, it is not clear if they used the youden index to define a dichotomic variable for each marker, and this categorical variables (as appears in Table 1) are used in the multivariate model, or you are using the cutoff as a continuous variable in the prediction. In a case you used a dichotomic variable, as it seems in the nomogram, you must define these new variables as categorical CAmarker or similar, to an easy interpretation of the results. In any case, to dichotimize markers provides you a more adjusted predictions to the development cohort, but rest a general applicability of the model in different populations. \r\n- In the results authors provide information about AUC, sensitivity and specificity. I suppose that sens and spec are estimated on the max Youden index. It is important to specify this in material and methods, and also to provide the cutoff point. Authors must verified that the Youden cutoff point of the models are in the range of values where the net benefit is superior in the decision curve.

However, there are still some concerns needing to be addressed before I can recommend publication of this paper in PeerJ:\n\r\n1.\tSome type errors should be carefully checked and avoided in the whole manuscript and English writing should be improved for better understand.\r\n2.\tAll references should be prepared according to publication manual of the PeerJ. 3.\tIn experimental section,  methods should be described with sufficient information. 4.\tIn discussion section, it would be necessary to compare this result with other fish gelatin-based edible film published previously. 5.\tWhy B. gymnorhiza and S. alba were selected as candidates of active compounds inserted into fish gelatin films? It should be discussed in the Introduction.\r\n6.\tIn my opinion, the characterization of materials was not presented in the proper way, the thermal stability of gelatin-based edible film should be added. ", "The manuscript is straight-forward easy to understand albeit with minor typographical errors. Both the results and discussion sections requires major improvement.\r\nFigure 1 is not clear. It should be labelled. Please add a scale/magnification factor. Standard methodologies were used but some is rather confusing and require further explanation.\r\nThe leaves of many plants have been shown to have antioxidant and antimicrobial activities - what is the reason for choosing two mangrove species in this study?\r\nLines 137-146: name the botanist who authenticated the leaves\r\nLine 153: please explain how the range of extracts' concentration was chosen - this is crucial as in the subsequent parts, the authors stated that low bioactivities were due to \"low concentrations of extracts\"\r\nLine 199: did the authors measured the pH at 80 degrees celcius?\r\nLines 214-223: positive control is missing\r\nLines 225-236: positive control is missing (positive controls are necessary to allow comparison of the results of test substances and some form of validation of the procedure in the assays)\r\nSD/SE is missing in Table 1 - how many times the analysis was performed?\r\nError bars are missing in Figure 6. The authors presented their results in tables and figures but description of their main findings in each section / table / figure is missing, for instance, there are no elaboration on the results of antioxidant and antimicrobial assays (lines 296-307).\r\nThe claims about phenolic compounds in mangrove extracts and hydrophobic polyphenolics (lines 351-362) are not substantiated.\r\nDirect comparison of values obtained in this study vs. those in the literature is not possible due to differences in methodologies (lines 406-408).\r\nPlease justify why comparison was made to a study that used a completely different sample than what was used in this study (lines 422-423).\r\nI Figure 6,  film without the addition of mangrove extracts showed considerable radical scavenging (10%).  Is this possible? Why are there two values reported when there is only one sample of film without any extracts. Please justify.\r\nLines 429-430: Please rephrase this sentence. \"higher antioxidant activities were recorded as a higher concentration of leaf extracts was added to the film\" - one need not perform the experiment to deduce this\r\nLines 430-431: \"Our study showed that adding 0.05-0.35% of mangrove extracts resulted in relatively low antibacterial activities\" The concentrations were decided by the authors. Again, there is very little comparison of the results obtained in this study with those in the literature.\r\nThe authors should revise the conclusion section. A more reasonable conclusion based on the findings in this study should be provided instead. The manuscript describes the preparation of fish gelatin-based film with addition of mangrove extracts and studies on the functional, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the resulting film. Findings are interesting but data presentation, analysis and interpretation is weak as explained above. Results need to be compared with the literature in order to make an accurate assessment of how the film fare compared to those that have been reported previously.

Although authors made a substantial revision of the bibliography, considering the number of recent investigations of AO in specific plants, authors need to integrate the information and include a discussion to establish further investigations or points of view. In addition, authors must use figures and diagrams to support the information in text and point out the missing information or opportunity areas for new research.

Considering the broad range objective of the manuscript, other keywords should be included to search among plants, mechanism, regulation, inhibition, etc. that helps to integrate the information in the manuscript. \r\nThe sources are adequately cited, but the organization of the review needs to be corrected in some paragraphs. Example: 66-68 indicates that details in AO in IAA production will be discussed later, but is not clear in the manuscript. There is a lack of paragraph connection in lines 104-105. It should be clear when authors make their personal interpretation or discussion (Example line 125). The introduction requires some structure corrections to better meet the goal of the manuscript. The authors dedicate an important part of the introduction to the zeaxanthin epoxidase enzyme function and precursors, which miss the idea covered in each subject of the manuscript. Also, the conclusion should include unresolved questions or further directions. The authors only dedicate three lines to the conclusion. The abstract should be improved in the specific points of view and discussion of the review.\r\nIn line, 38 authors indicate that ABA genes are identified in various plants but only describe enzymes characteristics and not gene regulation. \r\nI suggest the use of a figure or pathway diagram to better support the idea described in lines 40 to 46. \r\nIt is not clear if there is a lack of information regarding AOs or the existing information is not clear enough to support the two reasons described in the 50-54 lines. \r\nLine 68 - It is not clear which pathway the authors made reference.  \r\nLine 75-77 avoid independent and short ideas.\r\nLine 91-93- \u00bfIncomplete or missing idea?\r\nLine 95-97 is not necessary to explain. \r\n104 \u2013 105 lack of paragraph connection \u2013 miss the main idea \u2013 substrate specificity, structure, and expression? \r\n125-125 It is not clear if the sentence is an author idea or hypothesis \r\n126-127 The website has many tools, and it is not clear how the authors made the hypoxia prediction. \r\nLine 128 - In contrast with other AO described in the manuscript the information is scarce. \r\nThe table included does not support the manuscript.

"], "12969": ["In the manuscript entitled \u201cConnexin 43 participates in ox-LDL-induced autophagy in vascular smooth muscle cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway\u201d, by Xuqin Qin and colleagues, it is claimed that Ox-LDL-induced autophagy in VSMC is modulated by Cx43, through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. It is shown that Gap26, a Cx mimetic peptide corresponding to aa sequence in the first extracellular loop, which is used as gap junction blocker, prevents autophagy inhibition and foam cells formation induced by Ox-LDL. Moreover, it is suggested tht Gap26 effect on autophagy relies on theinhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. This study is biologically interesting and clinically relevant since the unveiling of the mechanisms and signals underlying foam cells formation can open new avenues to design innovative therapeutic approaches against atherosclerosis.\r\nHowever, the manuscript presents some flaws and weaknesses that limit its novelty and conclusions robustness. Indeed, the conclusions of this study are not supported by the results, which makes it very speculative.\r\nThe text seems needs a thorough revisions, in terms of both form and content. Indeed, the sentences are often vague, resorting to terms like \u201cautophagy regulation\u201d, with no description if there is an activation or inhibition of autophagy. . It is unclear the meaning of \u201cGap junction channels consist of two corresponding connexins\u201d\r\n. Hemichannels also allow the exchange of molecules between the cytoplasm and extracellular medium.\r\n. Many times, the references used are not appropriate to sustain the sentence. For example, Ref#20 is not the best one to refer to other functions of Cx.\r\n. It should be clearly mentioned that Cx43 can be a substrate of autophagy or a regulatory element of this pathway. This is of utmost importance in the context of this work.\r\n. In M&M section, line 100-105, the two sentences seem similar.\r\n. When using cell cultures, the term \u201cadministered\u201d should be replaced by \u201cincubated\u201d or \u201ctreated\u201d; also the terms \u201cintervened\u201d or \u201cinoculated\u201d do not sound suitable when referring to cell treatment or seeding. \r\n. The concepts \u201crandomly divided\u201d or \u201cevenly spread\u201d are not appropriate for cell cultures\r\n. The LY294002 group is missing\r\n. Information such as \u201cthe six-well plate was removed from the incubator, and the culture medium was discarded\u201d is useless in a scientific publication\r\n. In IF analysis, what the authors mean with  \u201cthe samples were sealed\u201d?\r\n. the concentration of reagents (PFA, Triton) should be provided in percentage\u201d\r\n. on the other hand, information about TEM analysis is very minimalist; more technical details are needed\r\n. The Oil red O staining protocol description is not helpful; it should be mentioned that was performed according to the manufacturer.\r\n. The results in Fig. 1 and 2 are not new\r\n. To be more accurate, when referring to protein changes, in this context should be used \u201cprotein levels\u201d instead of \u201cprotein expression.\r\n. Despite the accumulation of mRNA, how can the authors discard the possibility that Cx43 accumulation is not due to autophagy inhibition (Fig.2)? Autophagy flow should be assessed.  \r\n. The legend to Fig.2 should include the concentration and time of incubation with OxLDL.\r\n. the IF images are of bad quality, being difficult to discern any change in Cx43 localization. The most important aspect in Cx43 staining should be its localization to the plasma membrane, which is not visible. IF is a technique mainly to assess subcellular distribution and not for protein quantification\r\n. some explanation should be given concerning the characteristics and action of Gap26 and LY294002, as well as the rationale for their use\r\n. The mimetic peptide Gap26 is not a Cx43 blocker; to be more accurate, Gap26 modulates Cx43 channel activity. Are Cx43 levels affected by Gap26?\r\n. the TEM images are of bad quality and not convincing concerning the accumulation of autophagosomes (the use of arrows is not enough); scale bars are missing\r\n. In order to assess the impact/ role of Cx43, the protein should be silenced; when using Gap26 only channel activity is being affected.\r\n. The impact of LY294002 in autophagy has been widely reported\r\n. When referring to protein phosphorylation changes, the term \u201cprotein expression\u201d should not be used. The protein expression cannot be affected (protein levels are the same) but the protein undergoes a PTM.\r\n. In line 226, explain the sentence \u201cThis finding may be associated with the degradation of internalized Cx43 via activated autophagy\u201d \r\n. In line 226, there is likely a mistake, and \u201chigher\u201d should be replaced by \u201clower\u201d In general, the results do not support the conclusions ", "Title of this article should be absolutely revised because the authors demonstrated that blockage of Connexin 43 reversed the autophagy inhibition by ox-LDL. Therefore, the title talking about \"Connexin 43 participates in ox-LDL-induced autophagy in VSMCs...\" are mis-leading to the audience. I am so confused when reading the whole article. \r\nAccordingly, the title should be revised as \"Inhibition of connexin 43 reverses ox-LDL-mediated inhibition of autophagy in VSMCs.....\".\n\r\nAbstract should be revised as well, especially in the conclusion, because \"....by mediating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways\" are absolutely wrong, you should say \"....by inhibition of  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.\n\r\nEnglish writing should be polished further by native speaker, especially in results part. The overall experimental design is fine, but the antibodies used in Materials and methods got something wrong. What is anti-Desmin-actin? why need to add \"actin\" after all name of antibodies? In the results part, the first subheading \"Ox-LDL increased p62 protein expression and decreased Beclin-1 protein...\" mean nothings. I would suggest to simply the subheading as \"Ox-LDL inhibits autophagy induction in VSMCs via downregulation of autophagy-related protein\".\n\r\nIn line 209, \"To investigate the effect of Cx43 on foam transformation....\" should be revised as \" To investigate the effect of Cx43 inhibition on form transformation....\".\n\r\nIn line 211-213, \"These findings is suggested that ...\" should be rewritten as \"These findings suggested that blocking of Cx43 inhibited the ox-LDL-induced lipid droplet accumulation in VSMCs and suppressed VSMCs foam formation\". \n\r\nIn line 217, authors should firstly introduce LY294002 as PI3K inhibitor, otherwise the reader don't know why you use this inhibitor for your assay.\n\r\nIn line 225-226, Cx43 expression in the LY294002 inhibitor group was \"lower\" instead of \"higher\" than that in the ox-LDL group.\n\r\nIn line 226-227. The last sentence \"This finding may be associated with the degradation of internalized Cx43 via activated autophagy\" should be revised because you only demonstrated that Cx43 expression is depended on PI3K signaling by using PI3K inhibitor, how did you show the Cx43 is degraded due to autophagy? Any experimental works to show autophagic degradation of Cx43?

The authors did not mention how any oxidative damage to these organs (such as pancreas) could affect the final product, since most of these organs are removed as offal during the evisceration and degutting process. If there is any relationship between these organs and the final fish muscle (majorly eaten by the consumer) that can affect the quality of the latter, this should be well stated in the introduction and discussion aspects.\r\nIn addition, the difference between expanded pellet diet (EPD) and pellet diet (PD) were not clearly declared almost in the entire manuscript.

"], "12953": ["It\u2019s always nice to see an ecological stoichiometry project in a terrestrial system, and this is one of a small handful of such papers focused on bee species that I am aware of. \n\r\nThere is a high degree of copy, pasting, and extremely minor editing/rearranging from previous articles from the group. In the methods this introduces errors to the manuscript (e.g., \u201cflies\u201d, L161, https://doi.org/10.1093/cz/zoaa070). In the introduction it results in the first and second half of the introduction having extremely different voices and depth of scientific background. In one paragraph describing the study design only the year and the temperature of freezing are changed, even though they are supposed to be two different studies performed in two different years. While I could understand for repeating methods across studies, the authors do not even refer to the other manuscripts in such a way as would be typical for similar methods or study designs (e.g., \u201cmethods were performed following Citation (Year), and thus described briefly here\u201d). This is particularly stark in lines 62-78, 143-150, and part of the \u201cBumblebee Body C and N Content\u201d heading. The degree to which it is done in this manuscript is simply unacceptable, and borders on plagiarism especially when considering that most of the copy and paste is from an article which was published this very week (https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.696689). Given that I found at least two sources here makes me concerned that there may be more I missed as well. From reading the statistical methods, it seems that you used simple individual variable comparisons for each model as opposed to full models including all explanatory variables? This choice needs to be very carefully explained, as the models then do not reflect the study design and may be dramatically and incorrectly influencing the results. Further, on Gamma and Poisson distributions: Poisson makes sense to me for the latter models as those variables are clearly count data. I would add if you checked models for overdispersion and how you addressed that if present. Why was Gamma selected for the first set of models? Furthermore, there are extreme inconsistencies between the description of your analyses in the methods and the reported statistics. See line comments. \n\r\nFor the models that feed into your first paragraph in the Body Mass result (and Figure 1) it is unclear how you combined/split castes. It seems as though you lumped workers, gynes, and queens all together in some analyses but not others? Interchangeably using sex and caste for bumble bees is inappropriate; caste should be the focus given how biologically different workers vs. queens can be. Using sex for some analyses and caste for others makes understanding the results rather confusing. I\u2019d suggest having the castes together as a factor with four levels (workers, gynes, queens, males). This would allow you to streamline your models, stats reporting, and effectively combine figures 1-3. Something like a Tukey HSD would then very easily determine differences among castes and between habitats. The discussion and conclusion sections are insightful and well-written, though I anticipate significant changes will follow methodological clarity. I do think that the findings from this study could be interesting, and the discussion\u2019s focus on the trade-offs between bee health and reproductive output is a high-point and could be an important finding in the bee world. Other authors have discussed these ideas, but the dataset presented here is uniquely poised to directly answer questions of stoichiometric trade-offs in a social insect. However, given the methodological issues as well as the presence of blatant copy/paste, it is not acceptable for publication. Line Comments:\r\nL50: Opening sentence focusing on freshwater resources and fisheries does not fit the narrative of the study well. The rest of the opening paragraph is sound. Alternatively, more comparison against previous non-pollinator ES work later in the discussion could help make this a more broadly-accessible and widely-read manuscript. \r\nL73-78: Thank you for making the ES -> nutrition/health link. Most papers in this vein do not explicitly make this critical connection. \r\nL80-89: Filipiak has a few other recent papers that would fit well here:\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/insects9030085 and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79647-7\r\nL80-100: While not framed specifically within ES, there\u2019s a few other recent publications with %N in bee species which are likely to be relevant for you, and would help fill out this later section of the introduction: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-019-04577-9 and https://doi.org/10.1007/s13592-016-0480-4\n\r\nL103-108: Your argument that the apple orchards would provide better resources than the oilseed rape fields would vary widely based on location and the type of apple orchard. For example, in other countries apple orchards are often highly intensive agricultural environments, much like how almond orchards can be extremely stressful for honey bee colonies. Thus, I think your hypotheses are dependent on the context of the study areas described in your methods, and I would consider moving your hypotheses into your methods section or providing some of that system-specific context alongside your hypotheses in the introduction. Furthermore, as an organism\u2019s ecological stoichiometry is derived from their food source, it would help to discuss the stoichiometry and/or nutrition of the nectar and pollen sources present within and near orchards vs. rapeseed farms (you do mention this in the discussion; and it may be worth moving that here). While yes, complex habitats support a more diverse assemblage of bees, that relationship does not necessarily relate to ES. \n\r\nL131: repeated \u2018partially\u2019\n\r\nL143-150: This paragraph is copied nearly verbatim from another publication in your group, with only the year and temperature changing.

I think it would be essential to include in these models, as reproductive output could depend strongly on the colony.\n\r\nL195-299: The methods suggest that all models reported in this section used the same general framework and distributions. However, the test statistics reported vary widely suggesting a range of different analyses; I see chi-square, z statistics, F statistics, t statistics, as well as the omission of any such reporting (some with only a p value). Please review your models and revise. \n\r\nL303-314: Likewise, I am not aware of a Poisson GLMM which returns a chi square statistic as the test statistic for individual parameters. Are these comparisons of different models? Please make clear in the methods. \n\r\nL379: I don\u2019t think the results clearly make this determination. As you discuss in the previous paragraph, bees were likely more stressed in rapeseed fields yet they had greater reproductive output. The arguments on trade-offs are much more closely aligned with your results. \n\r\nL381-385: The phenology of the main flora of your habitats is an extremely important point, though I would expect the surrounding habitat would be more influential in the orchards due to the smaller patch size. \n\r\nL389: Relating results to tropical flora does not seem particularly relevant to the system. The hypothesis presented in this paragraph is interesting though. \n\r\nMinor thing:\r\n\u201cSubmitted\u201d articles are cited a few times.

The study is nicely motivated by appropriate conceptual theory.  The data appear to be appropriately analyzed.  The MS is clearly written. I have several comments and questions that need to be addressed in order to better judge the reliability of the data and the conclusions drawn from the study.\n\r\n1) The MS claims that oilseed rape fields are more stressful environments than are apple orchards.  But given that the study uses commercially reared (as opposed to wild bees) bees both kinds of habitat could be considered stressful to individuals that come from commercial sources.  So, is there independent information or evidence from this or previous studies showing that commercial bees placed in these different kinds of environment are indeed differently stressed?  For example, do this or other studies show elevated metabolism in one habitat relative to another, or altered immune-response in one habitat vs another?  Offering more insight about the potential level of stress that these bees experience in the different environments would strengthen the case that body C:N differences are indeed due to stress. \n\r\n 2) Do C and N contents of pollen and nectar differ between oilseed rape and apples? Could this explain the differences in bee C:N between the habitats instead of stress experienced in the different fields?  The fact that bee colonies in oilseed rape fields have higher fitness indicators might suggested that the stress hypothesis is not tenable. \n\r\n3) How long were the colonies left out in the respective fields?  The reason I ask is that if the colonies were out longer than the 10-day flowering period of apple orchards, where would the apple orchard bees get food for the remaining time in the field.  If they get food elsewhere or from other plants, how much would this influence the measure of C:N for bee colonies placed in apple orchards and fitness measures?  \n\r\n4) Line 154: It is unclear what \u201cpost-freezing\u201d means.  Were the collected colonies placed in a freezer to kill all of the adult and developing bees before analysis?\n\r\n5) The Results section lists a bunch of statistical analyses on various attributes of bees and bee colonies.  But the Methods section provides extremely vague explanations of how the various attributes were measured.\n\r\nHow was bee body mass measured?\n\r\nHow were individuals processed in the lab to extract measures of C and N contents.  Was pollen removed from the bodies of worker bees before analyses?  Were gut contents removed from individuals before they were processed to measure body C:N? \n\r\nWhat is the purpose of measuring the number of worker and queen cocoons and pollen and wax cells? What do more or less quantity of each of these various measures mean? Explaining this would help the general readership of PeerJ that is not familiar with bee colony life-history.  Also explain better how these variables were measured and why?  For example, are these fitness indicators? \n\r\nWhy were different caste members and sexes analyzed separately for C:N.  Do each potentially face different stress?  Please explain more the rationale for doing this.  \n\r\nThe Discussion tends to be a bit more speculative about the potential that oilseed rape fields are more stressful than apple orchards, as opposed to the Introduction section which sets the contrast up as an a priori test of hypothesis about the consequences of different stress on C:N stoichiometry.   Given my comments above, more information needs to be provided to offer a definitive a priori test of the stress hypothesis (i.e., rule out competing explanations).  This would be ideal: I like tests of hypotheses.  In the absence of being able to provide such information, the MS cannot provide a definitive test.  Consequently it should be rewritten to be more speculative, that is, to explore the potential for the different habitats to be differentially stressful based on measure of C:N stoichiometry.  This would be less ideal but perhaps the only option. The findings could make a novel contribution to the field if my concerns of alternative explanations are addressed. Minor comments:\n\r\nFirst sentence of the Introduction is superfluous.  Delete it as it has nothing to do with this study.\n\r\nLine 102: \u201chabitat quality\u201d is vague.  What defines habitat quality for bees?\n\r\nLine 109: The MS refers to Krams et al. (submitted) here and in many places throughout the text.  It would help the reader if the MS explained a bit more what that Krams study was about and what it found about C:N. that is germane to this study. \n\r\nLine 405:  This explanation is rather convoluted and hard to follow and contradictory to the main thesis of the MS.  Especially so, because the C:N data presumably indicate that oilseed rape fields might be more stressful for bees, yet here the reasoning makes the opposite case that it may be a better environment than apple orchards for bees to be active.  So which is it? A stressful or not so stressful environment? "], "12919": ["The manuscript entitled \u201cAnalysis and comparison of protein secondary structures in the rachis of avian flight feathers\u201d is a timely publication at the height of crystallography. Furthermore, the comparison of the species is well thought out and provides a encompassing view of flight feather\u2019s secondary structure. However, I have several general comments and one major revision that should be addressed before publication. \r\nMajor revision: \r\n1)\tThe authors attribute the identified secondary structures to only alpha-keratins, beta-keratins and collagen. However, we now know that proteins comprising the EDC genetic locus are widely expressed in feathers (Strasser et al. 2014 and more recent papers). The authors need to justify their attribution of these structures to just three types of proteins. Secondary structures of proteins are easily calculated using online bioinformatics tools. What are the secondary structures of these other EDC proteins? Could any of the beta-sheets or alpha-helixes be attributed to those proteins? Beta-sheets and alpha-helixes are very common among proteins performing a myriad of functions. Therefore, I think the authors should calculated the secondary structures of the EDC genes identified in the chicken (Strasser et al., 2014) in Results and justify their conclusion of those structures only being attributed to three protein types in the Discussion. \r\nMinor revisions:\r\n1)\tThe manuscript should be carefully read over by a native English speaker. There are several grammar issues and/or awkward sentences throughout the ms. For example these sentences should be revised (these are only some examples): Lines 31-32, 56-58, 89-90. \r\n2)\tThe introduction should include specific information on the flight modes of these birds. Also and related, the information in the first three paragraphs of the Discussion and first paragraph of the \u201cCollagen in the rachis\u201d of the Discussion should have been in the Introduction. \r\n3)\tThe information in the paragraph found on lines 201-210 should have references as this is not novel information. \r\n4)\tThe first figures cited in the text (lines 193-195) are Figure 1 and Figure 3. Therefore, Figure 3 should be renamed Figure 2. ", "The language: the English language should be improved to ensure that an international audience can clearly understand your text. Some examples where the language could be improved include for example lines 31-34, 40-42, 53-56, 76-78, 80-81, 89-90 (the adaption of the rachis medulla for flighting), and many other throughout the ms, where the current phrasing makes comprehension difficult, some sentences are ungrammatical or simply constitute sentence fragments. I would like to suggest you ask a colleague who is proficient in English and familiar with the subject matter review your manuscript, or contact a professional editing service.\r\nThe Introduction is well written and adequately introduces the research questions.\r\nThe selection of literature is good and relevant. See section 4 \u201cAdditional comments\u201d for minor remarks on the subject.\r\nIn my opinion, the structure of the manuscript meets PeerJ standards and disciplinary norms.\r\nI thank you for supplying the raw data, which is accordance with the PeerJ standards. However, your supplemental Excel sheets require a detailed description of the variables contained therein, e.g. in the form of a legend, to be useful to future readers and users. The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular structure (protein secondary structure, or PSS) of flight feathers in seven bird species, using up-to-date spectroscopy methods (ATR-FTIR and SR_FTIRM). Then the Authors sought to establish whether there was a relationship between the flight mode used by the species studied and the secondary protein structure composition of their feathers. Previous studies showed that mechanical properties of avian flight feathers (e.g. stiffness) depend mainly on the rachis structure. The Authors rightly suggested that the keratin and corneous protein composition is also important here. The research questions are well defined, relevant and meaningful.\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, the methods you used to molecularly analyze the feather composition are appropriate and up-to-date. These methods are described with sufficient detail and information to replicate.\r\nMy reservations about the methods concern the selection of feathers for analysis. You wrote that you analyzed \u201cflight feathers\u201d. But which feather? Rectrices, remiges, primaries or secondaries? Please specify.\r\nAnother problem is the choice of bird species \u2013 you sampled feathers from aviary birds (Mallards and chicken) and from wild birds (ibises). You did not account for the possibility that unfavorable conditions during molt in captivity may cause birds to deposit low quality keratin in growing feathers (e.g. Murphy et al. Can J Zool 66:1403-1413, 1998; Dawson et al. Proc R Soc Lond B: 267: 2093-2098, 2000). This could affect the results of your analysis. I warmly suggest you to address this issue in the paper.\r\nYou have classified the Mallard as a weak flier. This is not a good classification. Mallards are strong fliers, performing daily migrations between foraging and resting sites, migrations to molt sites, and even long-distance seasonal migrations. They have short, but high aspect ratio and high wing loading wings. Such wings produce high induced power and are adapted for fast and sustained flight over long distances (e.g. Rayner, Form and function of avian flight, Current Ornithology, 1988). Wing flight feathers in Mallards are certainly structurally adapted to withstand high aerodynamic forces.\r\nAnd last but not least. You aimed at looking for a relationship between feather structure and flight mode in study birds. But you did not perform such an analysis. I would suggest you to use statistics to compare flight feather morphologies between strong and weak flying species in your sample. The results obtained in this study are undoubtedly worth publishing. The rationale and benefits of peer-reviewed research to the scientific discipline are clearly stated and justified.\r\nFeather molecular structure analysis data are well presented. They are robust. However, I see no quantitative or statistical justification for the claims (lines 362-369 and 378-380) that differences in feather protein composition were found between good and poor flyers.\r\nConclusions are well stated in terms of the molecular structure of the feathers. However, I see no statistical justification for the statement that good and poor flying birds differ in the protein composition of their flight feathers. I strongly encourage you to provide such a justification.

"], "12897": ["I have reviewed the indicated manuscript which attempts to assess differences in the proteome of the synovial fluid (SF) derived from the knees of rabbits subjected to an ACL transection or exposed to a chemical toxin (monoiodoacetate). \n\r\nWhile the results indicate some differences, the experimental approach has a number of severe limitations, and as well the outcomes. Several of the figures presented (Figures 1-3) are not very informative in their current form and could be deleted. In particular, Figure on is  not relevant and Figure 2 does not indicate the state of the menisci, which is well known to be altered by 8 weeks post-ACL-T.\n\r\nAspects of the English language should be checked by an expert. The experimental design has a number of flaws which are indicated below:\r\n1. The ACL-T operation is an inflammatory stimuli and there is no sham group. While some of the inflammation may be transient, it can lead to changes in the SF.\r\n2. Use of the contralateral joint may not be appropriate due to the contralateral effect that is well known.\r\n3. The cells in the SF were not removed prior to freezing and thus, disrupted cells in the SF would contribute proteins.\r\n4. The sex of the animals was not indicated-readily corrected!\r\n5. The state of the synovium and the menisci was not indicated. In rabbits, after ACL-T, the medial meniscus undergoes degeneration by 8 weeks post-surgery. Also, the inflammed synovium contributes significant proteins to the SF including MMPs and other proteinases. 6. However, the MMPs, particularly MMP-13, were not apparently upregulated and this is well documented in the literature.\r\n7. How did the authors decide on the dose of the chemical toxin to use? Is it a maximum to elicit a response. This toxin kills cells in more than just cartilage-synovium, menisci, capsule, ligaments. Were the affected tissues repopulated by 12 weeks? No real histology presented or performed apparently. While the authors did detect some differences in the SF content following the two interventions, and the results may indicate differential responses, there are a number of limitations to the experimential design that limit interpretation and the significance of the differences. Based on other molecular changes that are known to occur following ACL-T in the female rabbit knee, it would appear that the primary methodolgical approach, that of 2D gels, is not sufficiently sensitive to detect the multitude of changes known to occur. The fact that the authors did not apparently remove the cells that are known to be in SF from both OA patients and the knees of preclinical animals with OA, presents a further complication to the interpretation. While the concept of SF proteomics may reflect the on-going progression of OA in the knee, as well as the type of OA related to the \"inciting\" stimulus, there are a number of limitations to the experimental design of this study that cloud the interpretation of the findings. ", "In general the experimental design is well documented. However, the limited number of 5 animals per group is not discussed or accounted for. Based on the outcome what should be the number of animals needed to provide reliable outcome (what is the power of the study)? \r\nAlso the choice to have only a macroscopical assessment of the cartilage OA grade feels somewhat limited. Histological evaluation or even biochemical evaluation would be more appropriate, especially to place the findings in a broader context. Why is not the synovial inflammation included?\r\nThis could be helpful to put the proteins found and the validity of the models in more clinical relevant perspective. \r\nWhat was the average amount of SF collected within each animal? In general, the findings seems valid and are appropriate discussed. However, this reviewer is not certain what message the authors really want to bring across to the readers. What is the clinical context? The models differ in outcome, which can be expected but is the one more appropriate to use or does this depend on the intervention you want to apply in such a model in relation to the protein expressed. \r\nAlso the limitations of the study are limited presented, especially with regards the use of a rabbit model. for instance, the marked differences in joint biomechanics and gait when compared to humans. In addition to biomechanical differences, important structural differences also exist between rabbit and human joint tissues. Rabbit cartilage is *10 times thinner than human cartilage (0.3\u20130.7 vs 2\u20133 mm) but has much higher chondrocyte density. The distribution of cartilage zones is quite different between the 2 species, particularly because the thickness and cellularity of the transitional and radial zones are highly variable in the rabbit, even among sites within the same joint. The rabbit meniscus is also more cellular; it has less vascular penetration than the human meniscus; and it can heal rapidly. Rabbit cartilage has been reported to exhibit spontaneous healing, particularly in relativelyyoung animals. (some references: Pedersen DR, Goetz JE, Kurriger GL, et al.

However, in its current form, the presented manuscript suffers from several shortcomings.\n\r\nThe English language and readability of the presented manuscript should be improved. Although being a non-native English speaker, this reviewer has identified several parts that are grammatically incorrect and also the overall fluency of the text could be improved. This reviewer suggests to ask an English-speaking colleague to proof-read the manuscript or pay for a professional service. A couple of examples with unclear phrasing or mistakes can be found in lines: 37, 46-48, 56, 62-64, 75-77, 84, 88, 94, 102, 208, 219-220, 241, 246-250, 256, 261-272 (but please, focus on the entire text).\n\r\nOverall, the structure of the manuscript is appropriate. This reviewer would just suggest to extend the introductory and result sections and possibly reorganize the individual method sections as described below.\n\r\nThe introduction could be improved and extended to better justify the need for this study. In the introduction, only a handful of references were used. In lines 53-55, it is not clear whether this is the authors\u2019 speculation or whether it is a known fact. Similarly, in the line 55, it is not clear where the assumption that silica contaminates SSB comes from. In line 58, more than just two studies could be cited. In line 59, the \u201crare\u201d research studies should also be properly cited to better place the current study in the context of known literature. Line 62 was not researched so its importance in the introduction is not clear \u2013 or can the predisposition to urinary tract stones be implied from the blood urea nitrogen (if so, it should be specified in the text)? In general, it is not clear how the blood samples are relevant for the study so it could be introduced. Similarly, the impact of fatty acid synthesis on milk production and composition is not introduced. The objectives of the study are within the scope of the journal. The research questions and aims of the study could be defined more clearly.\n\r\nThe end of the introduction (lines 61-65) implies that the goal of the study is to: a) investigate the impact of silica present in SSB on cows\u2019 physiology; b) determine whether SSB-enriched feed can be used in practice. However, the effects resulting from SiO2 presence in SSB were not sufficiently studied. Firstly, the values for SiO2 are missing in the raw data table characterizing the chemical composition of SSB. A control sample indicating if there is SiO2 present in the standard feed is missing. It would be better to quantify SiO2 also in the Table 2 and Table 3 to indicate the differences between standard and SSB-enriched feed (this reviewer does not ask for more experiments at this stage of the project; however, clear discussion of these aspects should be provided). In lines 244-245, the authors suggest that the ash is made up of silica. In its current form, this is just a speculation so this reviewer suggests to tone it down. Moreover, the effect of SiO2 is not covered in the results section. Overall, it would probably be better to modify/remove the parts regarding SiO2 as it is neither well introduced nor well investigated. A possible suggestion is either to improve these parts or keep the SiO2 part only for the discussion.\n\r\nThe remaining parts investigating the in vitro digestibility and in vivo disappearance of SSB are performed and described well. Methods are described with sufficient detail and information to replicate (if the English is improved) and the methodology used is adequate to the study. The authors provided processed as well as raw data and described well the statistical analyses. Several comments regarding the data provided are below.\n\r\nOne of the most important finding relies in the altered gas production, ammonia nitrogen and A/P ratio upon increased SSB levels. The authors attribute the decreased gas production to inhibited microbial fermentation due to increased lipid and silica content (lines 252-253 and 261-262). However, note that sugars and starches (which constitute the nature of SSB) are broken down easily and quickly. It seems that the gas production is directly linked to digestibility of the feed; where with good digestibility the energy produced is used to increase weight and production of milk, which is associated with decreased enteric CH4 production (doi.org/10.3390/ani11071870; doi:10.1017/S1751731113000876). In line with these observations, with increasing SSB levels the authors identified increased levels of propionate (and thus decreased A/P ratio) which is known to be an end-product of starch and sugar fermentation and whose presence is associated with decreased CH4 and CO2 levels (Moran, 2005, How the Rumen Works). Considering the fact that the milk production was slightly increased and there were no dramatic changes to the pH, couldn\u2019t this hypothesis, the simple fact that the feed was enriched for starch, better explain the results of the study? How the authors can be sure that the SSB-enriched feed does not provide enough nutrients to grow cellulolytic bacteria (line 266)? This is quite an overstatement since the authors did not investigate the grow of bacteria. Typical reader of scientific literature first reads the results section and only in the case when something needs to be validated he/she seeks the methods. In the presented manuscript, the results are written in a way that it is difficult to follow, partly due to a high number of shortcuts used. Please consider re-phrasing the results to make this section more readable. Additionally, results could be extended to cover all aspects of the manuscript and in greater detail. Additionally, there are shortcuts that should be explained earlier. For example, DM, TMR, NRC in the abstract are not explained.\n\r\nThe organization of tables is a bit confusing. First, the authors present a composition of feed used in the in vitro (Table 2) and in vivo assays (Table 3), respectively. Then, they present data in the reverse order, i.e. first the in situ disappearance rate (Table 4), followed by the in vitro gas production (Table 5) and fatty acid synthesis (Table 6). Wouldn\u2019t it be better to organize the tables in a more logical way and place the tables summarizing composition and results of the underlying assays next to each other? This would also help to understand the correlations between the composition and results of the analysis. In fact, it would be very helpful to provide a correlation analysis between the composition and analysis results to indicate a potential relationship between the variables and observed physiological changes (such as between EE, ADF, Ash and gas production, pH, ammonia nitrogen, fatty acids). For example, ADF is a good indicator of digestibility (doi:10.3390/foods8090364 and references therein) so it would be nice to see it confirmed also by this study. Additionally, a graphical representation of the data (similar to those in the supplementary excel file) would be highly appreciated by readers (indicating also the distribution/variability of the data).\n\r\nTable 1. There are multiple categories (CP, EE, NDF, ADF, Ash, SiO2, WSC) that are expressed as % DM. However, when these numbers are summed up, it gives > 177%. Similar discrepancy can also be found for the individual measurements in the raw data excel table \u201c1-2. Chemical characteristscs\u201d (check also spelling of the word \u201ccharacteristics\u201d in all the tabs of the raw data table). Is it because these categories overlap? It is basically explained by the lines 244-245 where the authors suggest that the ash is made up of silica. But maybe it could be briefly explained somewhere in the text not to confuse readers. \n\r\nIn raw data excel file tab \u201c2-1. IN SITU disapperance - DM\u201d (please, correct the typo), the time point 0 in the graph is based on value 32.63 even though the value should be 32.37 as demonstrated in the Table 4. Similar discrepancy is present for the time point 8.\n\r\nThe authors should indicate based on which criteria they decided to use 3% DM of SSB for their \u201cfeeding trial\u201d.\n\r\nThe authors should discuss the short duration (only six weeks) of the study. It is reasonable to assume that life-long supplementation of SSB could uncover more dramatic effects on cows well-being/milk production/weight gain.

TTF is a therapeutic modality that gaining wider interest, and having a real-time reporting/monitoring system would be beneficial. The literature and background/context for the proposed solution of EIT is well motivated. The article structure, figures and tables as presented are acceptable. The authors present an original result where the use a head phantom to test whether electrode configurations used for TTF can detect a tumor mass via impedance measurements. The results are in align with the hypothesis and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. The only perceivable weakness of the topic is that it reports on the feasibility of impedance measurements using TTF electrode arrays, that would be further strengthened if actual treatment vs. response were to be measured. Perhaps these experiments could be performed in a petri dish setting. \n\r\nFurther, the use of a potato, which is a heterogenous mass, in an otherwise homogeneous background is expected to provide distinct results as seen here. More nuanced studies or measurements where the inclusion has much less dramatic conductivity differences in comparison to the background would be of interest. ", "This is a fairly basic paper evaluating the potential of applying electrical impedance using tumor treating field electrodes as a means of assessing tumor response to therapy. In other words, one set of electrodes could serve as both a means for the treating the tumor and measuring the effect of treatment. The paper uses a fairly basic model of a skull, a potatoes of different sizes to mimic the tumor and a gel to mimic brain tissue. The demonstrate that impedance changes can be detected and these mirror tumor size. A sensitivity analysis is also completed. \n\r\nThe language is clear, the figures, sufficient, references look complete. \n\r\nBut the article is incredibly sparse and many details are omitted (see below). \n\r\nTable 1 does not need to be a table. The experimental design is very straightforward, but the model is a very weak approximation of human anatomy and the tumor behavior. GBMS are not simply solitary masses but rather are often deeply infiltrating tumors, with scattered neoplastic cells extending out far from any observable mass on MRI. Moreover, the brain has ventricles which can take up a substantial volume of the cranial vault. It is entirely unclear how the non-homogeneities in normal brain would impact this model as well. Thus the model is really quite unrealistic, yet there is absolutely no discussion as to these huge limitations. \n\r\nMoreover there is often considerable edema associated with these tumors...again another limitation that this model does not include. \n\r\nWe are told very little about the impedance methods used except the frequency (200 kHz), the rationale of which is not provided. It is also unclear which electrodes were used for the impedance measurements, and were these 4-electrode measurements (I think so)? And if so, which are the voltage and which are the current electrodes. \n\r\nWhat impedance system was used? \n\r\nOnly the impedance magnitude was measured. Why? They mention simulations showed that phase was less sensitive, but why not provide that information too? The validity is limited as noted above based on the very simplistic nature of this model. \n\r\nThere is no inclusion of any kind of skin layer which could also impact the findings. \n\r\nThe conclusions are vastly overstated the limitations of this very simplistic model are not included. See comments regarding limitations of the study design above. \n\r\nOverall, the results decided unsurprising and I think this adds relatively little to the literature, although the basic idea of using electrical impedance along with TTFs is good. I really which the authors had spent more time constructing a more realistic model than that presented here. The article is also short on many details.

One of the benefits of PeerJ is that the novelty is not a consideration here. Depending on your view of these references, a change to line 366 may be warranted.\r\n\u2022\tLine 369: \u201cWe found that the changes in gene expression were highly dependent on the biopsy timing\u201d. I would say that you need to say \u201cWe found that the conclusions/assertions/interpretations about the changes in gene expression\u2026\u201d. Just check for instances like this throughout but generally my sense is that you have may this qualification most of the time.\r\n\u2022\tLine 387-390: Excellent, this is the central issue in the manuscript and in the field so I suggest making much more of this point in the Introduction and Discussion. Erroneous interpretations plague the field.\r\n\u2022\tLine 396: proposed by whom? If so, why not measure it here? Overall I found this section and the IEG narrative to not work. I think it is very worthwhile to discuss the PGC-1 data but not as the current narrative. On line 411, the implication seems to be that the IEGs must be translated before changes in other mRNAs take place and that this is all very sequential. I find that hard to believe. A better explanation is that (as you describe later), the half lives of regulation of specific genes (independent of the IEG response) probably explains the gene-specific time courses. My read of your Discussion is that there is a lot of over-interpretation of what a change in mRNA means because it reads as though you are proposing that a change in mRNA of gene A indicates the role the function of the that gene\u2019s protein A will have on gene B. That is simply not the case. So lines 391-453 need some work in my opinion as it ends up focussing too much on gene regulation of different genes (for which you do not have data on regulatory elements) rather than the interpretation of the data you have to hand in the context of your overall aims. \u2022\tOverall the methods are described in nice detail, and experimental design has a lot of strong control/standardisation including the dietary control and the timing of later biopsies being devoid of influence of morning nutrition and circadian variation. In my opinion, the design with the baseline being 4 weeks before the HIIE is a major weakness, although you have done as good a job as you can in justifying it and cross-checking expression data in the straining study you reference. However, whatever about the basal expression of mRNA, the HIIE is performed by a muscle that is fundamentally different to baseline and given the effect of a training intervention on the acute molecular response to exercise, I think this point should at least be acknowledged in the Discussion. e.g. the lack of acute change or modest change in some genes may be a training effect. For example, the lack of change in GLUT4 (if I am interpreting the data correctly) could be explained by this point.\r\n\u2022\tRelated to this point, on line 125 you refer to the baseline biopsy timing being in order to reduce damage/stress but this seems to be a moot point given that there are then multiple biopsies in close temporal proximity and only 1 cm apart (which in my mind is unconventionally close together)?\r\n\u2022\tCould you add a statement about the time that the HIIE took place after the most recent HIIE session?\r\n\u2022\tLine 159: a sentence or two to explain the calculation of Wpeak is more preferable than the current statement.\r\n\u2022\tI suggest that adding a horizontal dotted line a y=1 to indicate baseline expression would be a useful addition to all graphs.\r\n\u2022\tIt might help the reader to also have the graphs in Figs 2 and 3 organised in terms of regulators as one cluster e.g. top half, and the mitochondrial and metabolic markers as another cluster e.g. bottom half. At present, I don\u2019t see a pattern to the way that the graphs have been organised. Just a tentative suggestion. \u2022\tMy major concern is the statistical analysis and given much of the rest of the manuscript hinges on these findings, I would expect that there may be major revisions of this submission depending on the outcomes of my concerns.\r\no\tHave the data been tested for normality in order to proceed with t-tests?\r\no\tWhat is the justification for using a 10%FDR rather than 5% which would be more consistent with the widespread use of p<0.05. Based on the q-values stated in Table 2, at an FDR of 5%, only 5 genes would have a peak that is statistically significant. I presume that the using the BH correction is in anticipation that the something like a Bonferroni is to stringent? Thus in both instances, you are increasing the chances of a Type I error. Of course this can be acceptable as an approach but in my opinion needs to be justified (small sample size, noisy data set, exploratory analysis, etc) with appropriate scientific references.\r\no\tThat said, given the research design and the stated aims, in my opinion a one-way ANOVA on the raw data (not fold change) with Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc correction versus baseline is the appropriate statistical test.\r\n\u2022\tThe major issue with all of the above is that you are arguing throughout the submission that the timing of biopsy central to interpretation of the response to acute exercise, yet one could also argue that the statistical approach is also a major factor.\r\n\u2022\tIn Table 2, I would then ask the question is there such a thing as time to peak and magnitude of peak if there is not really a statistically significant peak in expression? This is particularly relevant to line 301-304, which are discussing changes where there are some gene with no changes evident based on the statistical analysis; and whether the data in Fig 4 and 5 can be considered valid if there were not statistically significant peaks?\r\n\u2022\tGiven the stated aim is around time course and how that affects interpretation, I find it conspicuous that you then ignore something like NRF-1 at 24 h given its statistical significance and especially given NRF-1 is a mitochondrial regulator, which you state is your interest (GLUT4 is not mitochondrial for example). Similarly if I am interpreting the data correctly, you have a major downregulation of CD36, so would it not be of interest to discuss a downregulated gene give the premise of the submission about the importance of interpretation? \u2022\tLine 62 \u2013 Egan 2016 is not an appropriate reference here.

And \u201cexcept 6 participants\u201d, there is no mention of the other time points being n=9.\r\n\u2022\tI question the value of the 72 h data given (i) the n-size of 6 at 72 h, (ii) and the practical relevance of gene expression change at 72 h post-exercise considering that in both health and performance domains, the next training session will have almost certainly have taken place before this time. ", "The manuscript is well written and very clear. The authors clearly state the purpose of the work and why the study is relevant with the current gap in knowledge surrounding changes in mRNA expression following endurance type exercise over an extended 'acute' time course. Although a lot of literature exists surrounding acute mRNA responses to exercise the authors have well referenced relevant literature. The discussion although well written  is largely focused on PGC1-a, especially the first half, I believe it can be shorter and more concise.

Can the authors please address the following:\n\r\nThe timing of the \u2018pre\u2019 biopsy, 4 weeks prior to the acute post-exercise biopsies is a concern. For example the work by Miyamoto-Mikami et al. 2018, which the authors reference, did show that PPARGC1A (PGC1a) expression was up-regulated after 4 wks of HIIT, other groups have also demonstrated this (PMID: 23285255, PMID: 27604398). Other mitochondrial-related genes (PMID: 23285255), GLUT-4 (PMID 20010125) may be affected by relatively short training programs. \r\nAlthough the purpose of the current study is to better describe the acute affect of exercise on gene expression an increase in basal expression of gene expression following training (i.e. if the \u2018pre\u2019 biopsy was taken after the training intervention) may not affect the interpretation of results. I do think the authors should acknowledge this as a limitation.\n\r\nAs the muscle biopsies following HIIE were completed in a trained state (following 4 weeks of HIIT) the authors should emphasize that the time points identified which correspond to the greatest increases in gene expression are in trained individuals. Training can alter the response to acute exercise bouts and therefore the timing in which the greatest increase was observed in these individuals may not be the same in untrained individuals. \n\r\nCan you clarify how you identified the time point that elicited \u2018the most extreme mRNA content of each gene\u2019 was it simply the greatest numerical fold change? Other than the time points presented in table 2  were other time points also significantly different from pre? A few are mentioned in the text but if there are others this should be included in the table also and if this isn\u2019t the case it can be stated that changes were only evident at the time point presented in the table.\n\r\nLn 264 -  Can you please clarify how basal mRNA content was calculated?\n\r\nLn 355 \u2013 as the authors state a clear relationship isn\u2019t observed between mRNA expression level at baseline and the biopsy time point that had the biggest change in gene expression, this is clear in figure 5. But can you confirm how the lack of a relationship was determined? Was a correlation run? Why are only 5 genes highlighted in the figure 5? The authors aimed to address a gap in knowledge with respect to temporal responses in gene expression following a bout of exercise. As mentioned above I think it is important to highlight that these results are in trained individuals (completed 4 wks of HIIT) and the increases reported may not occur at the same time point in untrained individuals.\n\r\nThe authors use a relatively small number of participants n=9 and n=6 at 72h, is this small sample size sufficient to detect differences in gene expression from baseline especially based on the large variability in responses?\n\r\nCan the results described be extended to other types of exercise, specifically different modes of endurance exercise? This could be better reflected in the conclusion highlighting for the reader that different types of acute exercises may result in increased gene expression at different time points.

This will elaborate the mechanism of action of DIDO1. Figures 1C and S2 are not clear. It seems that GFP is higher in shDIDO cells. It should mean that the cells proliferation is higher in these cells as compared to control. If it is so, it will contradict the entire results.\n\r\nDid authors use an activator of CDK6 or CCND1 gene to check if there is any counter effect on DIDO1 action? It will confirm the mechanism of action of DIDO1.\n\r\nAll the GeneChip data can be seen in supplementary. Authors have written that 30 genes were analyzed by qPCR for the expression level determination. That data should be included. \n\r\nAuthors have discussed the inhibitory effect of DIDO1 on ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, however except the GeneChip analysis there is no other evidence provided. It will be great if authors can provide more qPCR/protein expression/phosphorylation data in control and shDIDO cells. Also, more can be discussed about this pathway how it can be beneficial in leukemia patients.\n\r\nIn schematic figure 4, it is not clear how or at which step DIDO1 is affecting ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.

The experimental system leading to the most critical data with Genechip is not described. It is not clear how the co-cultured cells were prepared for GeneChip analysis. The importance of the molecule of interest Dido1 in the context of leaukemia-activated endothelial cells is unclear. The authors are suggested to discuss the potential role of Dido in endothelial cells. In the manuscript by Cao et.al. the authors compare gene expression profiles of endothelial cells and leukemia-activated endothelial cells. They identified Dido gene expression to be downregulated in leukemia-educated HUVEC cells. They independently confirmed this using stable silencing of Dido1 in HUVEC cells and found that it resulted in cell death. They used publicly available data to identify that Dido may regulate cell cycle genes CCND1 and CDK6. \r\nListed below are the major concerns regarding this manuscript in its current form: \r\n1.\tThe authors have not detailed the method for co-culture of HUVEC cells with K562. It is recommended to give a detailed description of the procedure used prior to gene expression profiling by Genechip. \r\nWere the HUVEC cells separated from K562 for the GeneChip experiment? \r\n2.\tThe authors do not describe clearly the cell type in which the genes were upregulated or down regulated. \r\n3.\tThe authors do not sufficiently introduce the background information for Dido necessary to convince the audience of the importance of this protein in leukemia or endothelial biology. Previous results indicate that Dido is required for cancer cell proliferation (Neoplasma Vol.67, No.5, p.1074\u20131084, 2020) The authors are suggested to explain the relevance of Dido in the endothelial cells. The implications of this finding for cancer biology should be discussed. \r\nFurther, Dido1 has been described as a tumor suppressor gene. How does this current data align with previous literature on Dido1?\r\n4.\tWith the knockdown of Dido 1 with shRNA, do the other splice variants (Dido2, Dido3) get affected? \r\n5.\tIt is recommended that the authors revise the manuscript to check for \r\n- typographical errors: such as Genichip (Ln 41), \r\n- expand acronyms: such as MVD (Ln 82)\r\n- usage of biological jargons: such as leukemic induced ECs.(Ln 40)\r\n- sentences are fragmented and do not flow well.

Therefore, it is better to use ASD instead of autism.\r\n[4] In the results section, the author did not tell the unit of the CTRP3 measurement value.\r\n[5] I recommend the author to cite some latest studies or reviews of ASD diagnostic markers in the Introduction section, such as Shen et al., 2019, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05542-4_11; Shen et al., 2020, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2019.12.009\r\nMinor points\r\n[1] It is very strange, in lines 64 to 71, there are some yellow highlights.

Some other examples are in lines 27, 40, 96 & 255.\r\nThe raw data was shared and the tables were generally good. The general design of the study is good and the aims were relatively clear but some extra detail and specificity on the elements of the study would be beneficial.  In the methods \u201cintermediate category\u201d is used to describe the participants, but it is unclear if this relates to the standard of the athletes or the weight category of the athletes. Standard MMA categories in terms of level would be amateur, semi-professional and professional and so if it relates to this it needs to be standardised to the generally accepted norms. It is also unclear if the athletes compete in the same weight category. The inclusion of ranges for things like body mass, lean mass, and fat mass would also be useful. The change in body mass in that time-period appears much lower than would be seen in MMA athletes, some explanation or discussion here would be beneficial to provide clarity. The lack of training load data does limit the interpretation of the data somewhat as well although if it were possible to include if every athlete completed all sessions and how the sessions were split e.g striking, grappling, conditioning etc this may help. In terms of the statistical analysis, it is not made clear if the data were normality distributed or not. I also believe that the analysis used isn\u2019t the most appropriate. A Wilcoxon test has been used but this compares each series in pairs as opposed to performing the comparisons altogether with post-hoc paired analysis subsequently used.

"], "12649": ["In general: \r\nThe experimental study by Thomas et al. aimed to investigate in a LPS induced porcine sepsis and ARDS model the effect of a lung protective ventilation (LTV) vs a non-protective ventilation (HTV) on endothelial glycocalyx shedding in the systemic, pulmonary and cerebral circulation at baseline (before) and after 3 hours and after 6 h of LPS administration. Parameters of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary gas exchange, hematology and hemodynamics were obtained throughout the study. \r\nThey found no differences in hyaluronic acid plasma concentrations (obtained from central venous blood) in the Intervention groups (LPS+LTV and LPS+HTV). They also state they found no differences in hyaluronic acid plasma concentration before and after brain and lung passage, but data is missing for the measurements of hyaluronan in the pulmonary and cerebral circulation (not shown in Figure 2).  \r\nThe study on this clinically relevant field was performed thoroughly but is far from being mechanistic. The \u201cnegative\u201d results are important findings to further assess the role of the endothelial glycocalyx in the pathophysiology of ventilator induced lung injury. Yet I see major weaknesses. \r\nThe four major weaknesses I see in this study are: \r\n1.\tThe manuscript does not make clear how glycocalyx shedding in sepsis is related to glycocalyx shedding in ARDS. Clarification of this detail is essential for the presentation of this study. \r\n2.\tClarity concerning experimental setup. I suggest to make the following more clear throughout the manuscript: Primary Intervention is LPS induced sepsis; this sheds EG as measured by hyaluronan plasma concentrations after 3 and 6 hours in this porcine model. A second hit by HTV does not seem to lead to further shedding of EG. To explore the protective effects of LTV a later time of sacrificed might be more accurate. The choice of model should be discussed in more clarity. \r\n3.\tConclusions from the findings in this study are not well depicted. Clearer Conclusions from the findings are indispensable and would contribute to the scientific quality of this study.\r\n4.\tThe lack of confirmatory parameters for endothelial glycocalyx shedding. The authors investigated only a single indirect parameter of glycocalyx shedding, the plasma concentration of hyaluronan. They attempted to test heparan sulfate plasma concentrations, but due to technical problems could not provide valid results. I suggest the authors test another parameter to support their data e.g.: Syndecan 1, or MMP9 (Dogn\u00e9 S, Flamion B. Endothelial Glycocalyx Impairment in Disease: Focus on Hyaluronan Shedding.

Please provide information.\r\nUsed much higher LPS concentrations than Lipscey et al.: 160 \u00b5g bolus then 16\u00b5g/kg/h continuously, as compared to 1\u00b5g/kg/h, what was the rationale for this difference? Please clarify. ", "1.\tThe major concerns of this study are the unclear rationale and research question. As the authors stated, it has been reported that sepsis causes endothelial glycocalyx damage, which contributes to acute lung injury (Schmidt et al Nat Med 2012). While it is conceivable that ventilation could cause further damage to pulmonary vasculature after the establishment of ARDS, it is unclear how barotrauma leads to endothelial injury (and therefore, more HA shedding). I think that the manuscript can be strengthen by making a compelling argument in the introduction and providing more detailed background/context. I think this will lead to a clearly defined the study question. Perhaps authors can use references such as Choi et al 2006. \n\r\n2.\tThe article formatting is somewhat inconsistent throughout the manuscript. Half the sentences do not end with period which I think is the reference formatting issue. In line 248, references are formatted differently from the rest. \n\r\n3.\tMinor misdefined abbreviation; it should be \u201chyaluronic acid\u201d=HA, not \u201chyaluronic acid concentration\u201d. \n\r\n4.\tHeparan sulfate is included as a key word even though it was not measured in this study. It should be removed or replaced with hyaluronic acid to avoid confusion for readers.\n\r\n5.\tIn line 134, authors state that the animals that received LPS were randomly divided into 3 groups, while one of the groups did not receive LPS. This sentence needs to be edited. 1.\tIn Line 142, it was stated that animals that did not develop ARDS were euthanized. I think that this set of animals could have served as a great control to demonstrate the effect of LPS-induced sepsis alone. HA levels in plasma can be mostly due to LPS-induced sepsis and this group would have demonstrated the contribution of ARDS to this shedding if any. The data from this group would have also clarified how the authors defined ARDS specifically and demonstrated (possible) difference in lung histology. \n\r\n2.     Although authors stated that 20 animals were bred for this study in method section, line 102, I believe it was actually 26, if the euthanized animals were accounted for. \n\r\n3.     Please provide number of biological replicates in figure legends.\n\r\n4.\tAuthors described their compliance to ethical guidelines with regards to animal transportation and euthanasia well. \n\r\n5.\tI think that the method description for histological analysis could be improved. Although authors cited a study, it was unclear how authored scored the lung injury. It would be helpful for general readers if more description or examples of histological characteristics were shown. It was also unclear how many sections/field were evaluated per animal. 1.\tThe most concerning point regarding the validity for the study findings is the lack of data that directly addresses the study question #2. Figure 2 shows HA ELISA data from central venous blood samples, but in the main text, it was described that authors collected samples from multiple catheter lines to determine HA levels in pulmonary and cerebral circulations. Was HA measured as described? One of the study questions, as stated in line 93-94 was to determine the extent of endothelial glycocalyx depletion in pulmonary and cerebral circulations for which plasma HA was supposed to be the readout. Lack of this data significantly diminishes the scientific merit of this publication.\n\r\n2.     Figure 3 can be improved by showing representative histological images.\n\r\n3.\tAuthors stated in the discussion (line 264-267) that mechanical ventilation itself can compromise pulmonary integrity. If that is the case, proper control (no mechanical ventilation) should be included to demonstrate the effect of mechanical ventilation to experimental parameters.\n\r\n4.    The conclusion statement (line 323-325) is not supported by the data provided. As mentioned above, the effect of different ventilation regimens to pulmonary or cerebral circulations was not measured specifically. I understand that authors acknowledge the lack of direct evidence for EG degradation in their discussion, but I think that additional marker for EG would benefit the manuscript. If heparan sulfate ELISA did not work, perhaps syndecan-1 or chondroitin sulfate could serve as additional marker.

The author can easily address this by reconstructuring the introduction part and then clearly indicate the gaps of research. The research question was not defined properly. a lot of information are lacking particularly the reagents and chemicals section, the model and brands for the equipment used. The authors had only performed one replicate extraction for all analysis. The authors has to include the said information and the justification on why they only performed one replicate for the extraction. The authors had only performed one replicate extraction for all the assay analysis. the authors had also not indicated if whether the assays used were validated based on the ICH guidelines. \r\nThe result of the TLC analysis for naringenin has to be improved. include the Rf values of the standard and the unknown and if possible run it in a solvent of higher polarity so that the compounds will be sitting in the middle of the plate. the NMR analysis of the compounds are insufficient to prove that the compounds analysed were actually fatty acids. the fatty acid determination using the GC-FID is promising but i suggest that the authors should also add more verification for this. Quantification can also be done for the fatty acids so that the claims of detecting it in the be pollen samples can be more valid. I commend the authors for using a bioassay guided isolation technique which is very helpful and useful to ensure that what ever secondary metabolite obtained is bioactive and of significance.\r\nThe abstract is very informative and had covered all the necessary information for a summary, however, it is too long.

"], "12703": ["General comment: My main concern in this section is that authors propose the developed system \u201cfor utilization as part of a monitoring system and an ideal tool for environmental risk assessment\u201d. In the introduction information of environmental relevant concentrations of all these chemicals in aquatic ecosystems, both non-directly exposed and directly exposed, is currently missing. This is basic information to understand the sensitivity of the proposed system. It is not my role to look for this info in the bibliography, but I think that the concentrations used for the authors are several orders of magnitude higher than the commonly found in the environment. I would be very surprised if rodenticides were found in aquatic ecosystems not directly exposed at concentrations higher than low ng/L\u2026 If this is the case, the proposed system is not sensitive enough for environmental applications (at least for rodenticides\u2026)\n\r\nSpecific comments:\n\r\nLines 41-43: \u201cToxic substances, such as cyanide, organophosphates and rodenticides, have appeared in the water environment, and have even been reported to cause poisonings in humans and public safety emergencies\u201d. I agree with the authors that: (1) it is possible to find these chemicals in water, and (2) that there are cases in humans of poisoning for most of them. But these (1) and (2) are two independent facts. In this sentence, reader can understand that levels of these compounds in water can result in human poisoning. And this is not what the references say (all of them are about suicides, homicides...). Therefore, the next concern raising is about the toxicity or safety of the normal range of concentrations of these chemicals in aquatic ecosystems, that has not been indicated in the manuscript. Authors should provide detail on the environmental levels of the eleven chemicals they have been testing in the manuscript.\n\r\nLines 60-62: \u201cImportantly, the existing studies correlated behavioral changes of zebrafish induced by toxicant exposure with alterations in physiological indicators\u2026 \u201c Please, provide references.\n\r\nLines 86-88: \u201cCompared with adult zebrafish, the behavioral changes of larvae occur at much lower toxicant concentrations, allowing earlier detection of contamination\u201d I can't agree with this statement. It depends on the toxicant. For instance, for OP insecticides embryos or early larvae are more resistant than the adults, as adults die very quickly after respiratory arrest. As in embryos and early larvae an important part of the gas interchange takes place through the skin, they are able to increase the survival.\n\r\nLines 93-94: \u201cIn another study, the exposure to low concentrations of pesticides (1 ppb) in the aquatic environment\u2026\u201d In my opinion 1 ppb it is not necessary a low concentration. Many pesticides are commonly found in aquatic ecosystems in the range of low ng/L\n\r\nLines 104-105: \u201cThe aim of this work was to develop a robust system with sensitive detection capability of several toxicants in water, based on the behavioral changes of zebrafish larvae\u201d It seems that authors intend to develop a sensitive system for detecting some chemicals in water. But first of all they should provide information on the range of concentrations of each chemicals in aquatic ecosystems, both in directly exposed locations and in non-directly exposed locations. If they are able to detect these chemicals at concentrations in the range of non-directly exposed ecosystems, then they'll have developed a sensitive system suitable for environmental monitoring. However, this hasn\u2019t been demonstrated by the moment. General comment: I have a problem with the behavioral analysis performed in this study. It has sense to analyze behavior when there is no signs of system toxicity, but it seems that only lethality was recorded. There is no indication on the general state of the larvae at the highest tested concentrations. We can see a significant decrease at the highest concentrations only because the larvae were near the dead or it was a specific effect on the nervous system?\n\r\nLine 120: \u201cThe adult wildtype zebrafish (~3 months old, 2.5\u20133.0 cm in length)\u201c.

Why are then stored the larvae? The true is that to have some additional endpoints (transcriptomics or metabolomics) to integrate with the behavioral endpoints should be great. The point is that if some additional analyses are going to be done with the exposed larvae, the best is to join all the info in one manuscript.\n\r\nLines 138-140: \u201cThe stock solutions of KCN, difenacoum, bromadiolone, diphcinone, coumatetralyl, flocoumafen, and fluoroacetamide were prepared in deionized H2O and stored in the dark at 4 \u00b0C\u201d For how long the stock solutions were stored at 4\u00baC?

It means the summary of the 6 periods of light (10 min each) and the 6 period of dark (10 min each)?\n\r\nLines 167-169: \u201cThe inhibitory capacity of the toxicant on the behaviour of zebrafish was assessed as the IC50, i.e. the concentration at which the cumulative distance travelled was reduced by 50% over 60-120 min compared to the control group\u201d. I only want to congratulate the authors because they are very lucky. They have found the IC50 for 11 chemicals within the same range of concentrations (10 ppb-10 ppm) !!!\n\r\nLine 170: I have seen that authors have tested normality and homocedasticity of the different distributions and they have used then the appropriate statistical test. This is a good point. However, this raise a new question: if there are some data that don\u2019t follow a ormal distribution, why all the graphs in the Figures are based in parametric statistics (mean and SEM)? In my opinion it would be better to use boxplots with the median instead of the current bar charts.

I'm not sure if behavioral analysis started at the end of the 2h exposure. I don't know if larvae were also exposed during the 2 h of the behavioral analysis. All these details should be clarified.\n\r\nLines 191-194: I don't understand all the effects that authors claim to see: inhibition, excitation, avoidance... As I can't see any statistics after each comment, I suppose that there are no statistically significant differences, and therefore, there are no effects.\n\r\nLines 197-200: \u201cThen, we assessed the behavioral impairment of zebrafish using the cumulative distances travelled by zebrafish larvae over the three cycles totaling the first 60 min (0-60 min) and over three cycles of the second 60 min (60-120 min) of exposure\u201d I'm not extremely happy with this decision from authors. First of all, authors should justify the need to perform 6 cycles L/D. Why they are performing 6 cycles? What information they expect to obtain performing 6 cycles instead of 1 cycle? From my point of view, it is not very interesting to pooling the locomotor activity of L1/D1/L2/D2/L3/D3 and L4/D4/L5/D5/L6/D6. I don't know what exactly authors intend to obtain.\n\r\nLines 205-206: \u201cSince 10 mg/L KCN was apparently lethal, there was no swimming detected in this exposure group\u201d I don't understand the meaning of \"10 mg/L KCN was apparently lethal\" All the larvae died? Some larvae died? Not only lethality, but also any sign of system toxicity should be carefully surveyed before to start any behavioral test. On the other hand, why authors don\u2019t include here the description of the effects on sinuosity and burst behaviors??\n\r\nLines 208 and 226: The same section title!\n\r\nLines 232 and 239: Exactly the same statistical information is provided.\n\r\nLines 287-288: \u201cClustering analysis of cumulative distance travelled by zebrafish larvae, a common method for assessing the neurotoxicity of toxicants to organisms\u201d I'm not so sure that accumulative distance across 3 different L/D cycles is to common method, as it is unclear usefulness of the information that this approach provides.\n\r\nLines 292-294: \u201cThe reduction of sinuosity on zebrafish larvae indicated that the balance of movement was disrupted, and has been reported in Parkinson's-like behavior resulting from nerve injury (Bortolotto et al., 2014)\u201d This sentence is not related with the results, but with the discussion.\n\r\nLines 299-302: \u201cIn general, the clustering pattern of concentrations was consistent at the three behavioral endpoints, i.e., consistent behavioral capacity at concentrations of 0 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L, and 0.1 mg/L, with a difference from 1 mg/L and the greatest difference from 10 mg/L\u201d It was really necessary to perform the hierarchical clustering to get this conclusion?

As solvents are well known to cause effects in behavior, the solvents should be kept at minimal concentrations, and whenever possible, well below recommended values in order to avoid biased results and/or mixture effects from solvent + target substance. \r\n2-\tChemical analysis is lacking in the methodological approach. The inclusion of this data is extremely relevant to fit the purpose and objective of testing the behavioral assay to detect the selected substances.

How many cells were tested? \r\nThe dye utilised is not suitable for chromosome counting, but for bacterial and cell wall staining.

The authors have discussed findings well and in line with the data provided. All bench and calculated data has been provided in a clear and usable manner.

"], "12110": ["The authors have submitted a review on stress-regulated elements involved in stress adaptation signaling in Lotus spp. This is a very interesting and missing piece of information in legumes. A list of interesting examples of diverging stress-related behaviors among the Lotus species are reviewed. The survey methodology should be improved (see below) The reported information are important to postulate interplay between different biotic and abiotic stresses and responsive elements, paving the way for the obtainment of legume stress resilient genotypes. The review is well written and the reading flows nicely.\r\nSee also general comments below I have two major criticisms.\r\nThe L. japonicus MG20 and Gifu are the two accessions mostly used as model systems for fundamental studies. The authors report the Sato et al. 2006 reference (web site: http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/index.html) where information and tools are provided. I found quite strange that all over the review, the authors never cite the Mun et al. 2016 paper (web site: https://lotus.au.dk/) , where some innovative tools are also provided. In particular, the co-expression toolkit is something that the authors should have exploited to support (if possible) some of the interesting correlations they report, aimed to identify putative protein-protein interactions playing roles in the stress-related signaling pathways.\r\nAnother missing point is the lack of information on the pathways affecting the flowering time in Lotus spp, the TF involved and the correlation with stress conditions. This is a crucial phenotypic treat for biomass production in forage legumes and the MG20 accession, which is known as an early flowering accession, could provide important clues.\n\r\nMinor points\r\nI would suggest to divide the two main sections, Transcription Factors and Chaperons, redox\u2026.. in subtitled paragraphs. The subtitles of the TF section could be the names of the different TF families analyzed. In the case of the second section, I would suggest to subtitle with the different kind of stresses analyzed (e.g. Salt stress, drought\u2026).\r\nOn my view, the paragraph on the CBS motifs (lines 294-302) could be eliminated. There are too poor information reported in literature to state their roles in stress response pathways. \r\nLine 108, In vitro in vivo. Italic ", "This contribution is a review of bibliography of the proteins and genes involved in stress signaling in several Lotus spp (as expected, mainly from the model L. japonicus). The focus is on stress signaling networks and the paper is organized in two major blocks: \"transcription factors\" and a miscellaneous section including  \"chaperones, redox signals and proteins of unknown function\". There are abundant studies on transcription factors and more scattered information on the other types of proteins. I would make \"hormones\" a separate section, as they cannot be included in the second block. The authors briefly describe polyamines, strigolactones, ethylene and ABA. The description of results on these hormones needs to be expanded and should encompass other hormones and defense-related compounds such as jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. For clarity and easier reading, the authors should consider also making a specific block for antioxidants, which can include information on thioredoxins and phytochelatins from the second block, as well as reports on ascorbate metabolism, thiol metabolism, superoxide dismutases and catalases. mention to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) is also lacking. These reactive species are clearly involved in stress signaling. There are several papers linking these enzymes and metabolites in the response to drought and salt stress. English is quite good and the text can be read without problems, but the paper needs to be revised by a native speaker because there are numerous errors of syntax and grammar. A double-check for correct citations in the text and literature secion needs also to be conducted (for instance, citation of Xie et al. 2019 is not included in the bibliography section). Also, the paper requires a thorough revision of English language. The article is within the scope of the journal. The survey of literature is unbiased but incomplete. Studies on antioxidant defenses in response to stress and on additional  hormones and growth regulators are lacking. Also, in most cases it is unclear if the data come from non-nodulated plants or from nodulated plants. That is important because nodulation may make a major difference in sensitivity/tolerance to abiotic stress. Blocks of information (sections) need to be reorganized. Also, there seems to be little connection between the sections. It would be desirable to try to put the review of genes/ proteins into the context of a metabolic and regulatory framework. In this respect, one or two figures addressing the pathways of stress defense and signaling would facilitate reading and would make the review more appealing. The novelty of the literature survey is justified as it includes both the model Lotus japonicus and other Lotus spp. (L. tenuis and L. corniculatus) that are relevant as cultivated plants or in natural ecosystems. The conclusions that L. japonicus can be used as a model to study stress signaling is straightforward. However, a similar study could have been performed using another model legume such as Medicago truncatula and its related crop species M. sativa. In other words, it is fine to focus on Lotus but similar conclusions could have been obtained by examining literature of molecular stress responses in Medicago. The review is of interest to a broad readership, ranging from plant physiologists and agronomists to geneticists and molecular biologists. The review is a literature survey of Lotus spp. in response to stress. The idea and timing for this review are fine, but the paper needs reorganization, expansion and some \"glue\" between sections. One or preferably two figures are required to provide a global picture of the genes/protein being reported. This would also enhance the interest and understanding of the review.

The manuscript submitted is original, clearly within the scope of PeerJ and builds upon previous works of some of the co-authors that have a solid publication record on using FATM to shed light over the trophic regimes of nudibranchs. The manuscript has a well-defined research-question that contributes to advance the state of the art (and the authors clearly explain how they will do so). \r\nWhile the research is sound, with high technical and ethical standard, there are some important details missing in the methods that require attention by the authors.\r\nIn the methods, the authors must detail what was the amount of sample injected for FA analysis?

Please clarify this important issue. Performing a one-way PERMANOVA can be an option to compare the FA pool of each species as whole against each other to confirm or refute significant differences. However, n=2 for A. papillosa is a caveat for this and other statistical analysis\u2026 Please elaborate on this. Moreover, if raw data were % of FA was it not necessary to transform your data prior to analysis? Please confirm this, as well if the assumptions of ANOVA were always met so there was no need to perform non-parametric statistics (but first pay attention to the fact of n=2 for A. papillosa. While the findings reported are certainly relevant, the authors must clarify the issues referred above concerning their statistical analysis. The authors may also consider suggesting the use of molecular barcodes of gut content of these nudibranchs in future studies to support their assumptions on the feeding regimes of these deep-sea species. The use of FATM provides indirect evidence (and the authors must be cautious when reporting their findings) of trophic interactions and may not be able to discriminate which prey is being ingested to genus or species level. Given the issue I refer with your statistical analysis I consider that this study requires a major revision before being accepted for publication.\r\nPlease see the PDF file I am attaching with my comments. ", "This is a very interesting paper focused on the little-known topic dealing with the food preference of Nudibranchia. The trophism of five species is studied using the fatty acid trophic markers (FATM) that is poorly used in this group of mollusks. This is a still unexplored field and this work can be an excellent starting point. The English is good and the paper is well structured.\n\r\nAnyway, I suggest to implement the data on the genera investigated and in general on the biological and ecological context dealing with the species investigated. In fact, I found that the technique used and the results obtained were well explained but the paper does not give the instrument to understand the biological question that is behind this paper. Why is it important to understand the trophism of these species, why and how it is useful the FATM to explore the ecology of these species. I found the paper difficult to follow. Increasing the references cited or reporting data on the state of the art on the knowledge on the diet of related species could be very useful to easily follow the paper and quickly understand the meaning of the study carried out. For example, as little is known to date about the diet of nudibranchs, I find it a bit superficial not to mention all the few works published to date, at least on the genera treated here. I suggested some of these papers directly on the attached pdf file. It is not clearly reported in the text how many individuals were analyzed and the lack of any kind of pictures of the species investigated make this paper a bit abstract and too methodological. Furthermore, I think that these data should be included also because two of the five analyzed species are not identified at species level but reported as \u2018sp.\u2019.\n\r\nAnother point is about the comparison with different species from shallow water as A. papillosa and C. verrucosa. In fact, in the discussion section, you stated that: \u201cConsidering the close similarity between the FATM profiles of A. papillosa, C. verrucosa, and Dendronotus sp., we assume that the increased 22:5n-6 and C20 MUFAs levels in the deep-sea nudibranch Dendronotus sp. from the Sea of Okhotsk indicate its preying on sea anemones and/or anthoathecates hydroids, similarly to the shallow-water species, A. papillosa and C. verrucose.\u201d This concept means that the FATM profiles are not so specific for the prey because the three species here discussed (Dendronotus sp., A. papillosa and C. verrucosa) are very distant in terms of evolution and diet and I would aspect to found differences in the FATM profiles. I think that this aspect should be better explained or clarified. I really appreciated to read this paper that is focused on the important, and very hard to study, aspect of the trophism in nudibranchs. The fatty acid trophic markers (FATM) are a consolidated technique but still little used in this group of mollusks today and for this reason this paper is original and interesting. This work can be an excellent starting point to understand and fill the gap of knowledge on this unexplored field of study. Anyway, as I stated above, I think that the authors should make a little extra effort to better explain the biological question behind their work and allow the reader to understand the study done and its possible importance and applications.

Examples include line #s 112, 161, 165, 168, 322, 401 etc.\n\r\nThe authors refer to S-2-HG as an oncometabolite. It is in fact R-2-HG (D isomer) that is the oncometabolite and S-2-HG (L isomer) is actually a hypoxic metabolite. It is requested that authors rectify the discussion surrounding this in the introduction section The authors describe the experimental protocols and procedure is great detail and provide the raw data sets for their results, which is great to see. I have the below questions/concers about the experimental design\n\r\n1) Why did the authors use only female rats and not males? The authors do not provide any justification for this choice. Liver injury or liver transplant is not a sex specific pathology and I am not aware of any statistics that suggest that the incidence/risk factor is higher in females. As such, both sexes should be evaluated in the study.\n\r\n2) The authors use S-2-HG as a inhibitor of EGLN family prolyl hydroxylase to sustain levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). However, the authors do not evaluate prolyl hydroxylation levels in presence and absence of S-2-HG to ensure that there is target engagement by inhibitor. Similarly, there has been no evaluation of the HIF levels in control, IR and treatment+IR groups. This is a major shortcoming of the study.\n\r\n3) The authors cite the previous use of S-2-HG for its beneficial effects in nephroprotection from IR injury. This study is from the same group as the authors of the current study. However, a sodium salt of S-2-HG is very hydrophilic and is unlikely to cross the lipophilic cell membranes to exert its inhibitory effect on prolyl hydroxylases. It is therefore possible that S-2-HG is exerting the limited hepatoprotective effects through some other mechanism, which the authors need to investigate.\r\nTo claim that S-2-Hg/prolyl hydroxylase/HIF axis has been enganged, the authors need to provide enzyme activity and/or western blot data showing S-2-HG inhibits the intended target.\r\nAlso it is suggested that authors synthesize and use a dimethyl ester form of S-2-HG which is likely to much much more membrane permeable than the disodium salt.\n\r\n4) Authors use only liver injury and inflammation biomarkers to assess the effect of S-2-HG in their model of IR injury. No infarction or functional recovery data after S-2-HG treatment has been provided to show beneficial effect. Authors are requested to generate this data. The statistical analysis on some data needs to be reevaluated. For example in Figure 1c, the difference in AST levels between IR and HGIR groups is unlikely to be significant.\n\r\nThe figure legends need to provide information regarding the reported error bars i.e. they represent standard deviation and not standard error. ", "Cienfuegos-Pecina et al present an original research article titled \u201cTreatment with sodium (S)-2-hydroxyglutarate prevents liver injury in an ischemia-reperfusion model in wistar rats.\u201d Previous studies have shown that preconditioning and the potential activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury. The authors proposed that inhibition of EGLN by sodium (S)-2-hydroxyglutarate, resulting in HIF activation attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs due to anoxic liver injury after major resections and transplantations or in response to systemic hypoxia. The manuscript is clearly written with detailed statistical analysis, sample size calculations and easy to follow graphical presentations. 1. In the introduction the authors state that the rationale for using (S)-2HG is the inhibitory effect on EGLN, which potentially activates HIF and attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury. The authors do not provide any data on EGLN1-3 activity or HIF1/2. Without these additional measurements it is not possible to assess the validity of the hypothesis. (S)-2HG can be converted to alpha-ketoglutarate and potentially used as a carbon fuel in the Krebs cycle independent of HIF regulation. The authors need to expand their experimental model to account for these factors.\n\r\n2. Reperfusion injury is a dynamic process that involves immune cell activation and cytokine release, as well as reactive oxygen species. The authors focus on clinically relevant liver function tests that can be assessed in the blood (e.g., ALT, AST, cytokine release). However, other processes that have been implicated in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury are not included. For example, anaerobic metabolism, mitochondrial function, intracellular calcium overload and kupfer cell activation are not investigated. (S)-2HG has been shown to affect the activities of mitochondrial dehydrogenases and overall redox state of cells (see Intlekofer AM 2017;13:494-500). The authors need provide additional data on the metabolic effect of (S)-2HG. \n\r\n3. The authors need to provide additional data that show the degree of liver injury in the experimental model. For example, histology and measurements of tissue edema and distribution.\n\r\n4. The authors only use female rats in their study. Please provide a justification for using only one sex.\n\r\n5. The bar graphs should be replaced with dot blots to show individual data points. The authors do not provide sufficient data to support their initial hypothesis that EGLN inhibition by (S)-2HG protects against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. \n\r\nObservations made by the authors may be valid and reproducible, but the provided experimental data is not sufficient to support their initial hypothesis.

Authors have found no statistical difference between LTL in COPD patients` and controls\u00ac` group, although for the patients` telomeres were slightly shorter. They found that the carriers of the common homozygous genotype of the SNPs (rs12696304 C and rs10936599 C) had higher risk for COPD in comparison with other allele variants, which is an interesting observation that the minor alleles have rather protective properties, and it could be studied further.\n\r\nRecommendation for the corrections:\n\r\n1.       Introduction. \r\na) Line 34 needs correction of punctuation mistakes. Needs precision of what is the minimum number of telomere repeats.\r\nb) Missing a clear hypothesis of the study. 2.       Methods.\r\na) The description of samples also could be clearer. As it is not clear why for example only a small part of samples was used for the LTL determination. Why is there a difference for an average age of about 10 years for the control group and patients? As for TL there is a difference in these two age groups in the literature.\r\nb) Table 1 and other Tables too must be more in order so that text is aligned everywhere and are not so chaotic. Table 4 has a mistake, is it 19 or 190 samples?\r\nc) Regarding qPCR for TL determination. Authors have measured absolute TL, but that number is very high (healthy people in average 21 271 bp). There is information in the literature showing that an average telomere length ranges from 10 to 12 Kbp in new-borns to 5 to 6 Kbp in people older than 60 years. The method for the TL determination should be reconsidered and rather relative TL should be measured (Cawthon, 2002). \r\nd) Also, in description of qPCR for TL and reference genes Efficiency should be determined (and should be from 95-105%). Samples are better to run in triplicates not only in duplicates as it is a rather sensitive method. 3.       Results.\r\na) The first two titles for the subsections should be written in synchronized form.\r\nb) It could be interesting to see if there is a difference in TL among those three COPD stages, although it is clear that the sample amount is small for the last stage.\r\nc) As I wrote before the assay for measuring should be considered as authors did not see difference in age, sex and smoking habits which is rather unusual as in the literature these are factors that clearly affects TL. \n\r\n4.       Discussion.\r\na) Text is a bit chaotic which makes some parts of the text seem redundant.\r\nb) Lines 221 and 222 need punctuation correction.\r\nc) How can authors conclude that LTL is shorter in patients with COPD, but it is not related to the genotype? I did not find any description in the results about TL in different genotypes. I don`t think that conclusion can be drawn only from a fact that they obtained higher frequency of the referent allele of both SNPs (rs12696304 and rs10936599) in the patients` group with shorter telomeres, especially if the difference was not significant and samples were not that many.

This approach will enable most readers to better understand the relevance of the study objectives and the relationship between the risk factors under investigation and heart failure as a chronic disease\r\n\uf076\tAlthough the researchers have attempted to discuss the relationship between the individual risk factors under investigation and chronic heart failure, the underlying physiochemical mechanisms that explains and establish these relationships remain unclear (For example: how will hypo or hypercalcemia affect prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure). These mechanisms should be briefly but explicitly described with proper references. \r\n\uf076\tChronic heart failure classifications have been adequately discussed. However, there is no mention on how these patients were diagnosed with heart failure and whether diagnosis was conducted and or confirmed by a residency trained and board-certified cardiologist.

The use of signs and symptoms plus electrocardiographic findings for the diagnosis of heart failure will be more appropriate. \r\n\uf076\tThe researchers have also clearly indicated in their manuscripts that, study participants were divided into two groups. However, there is no mention of how these participants were selected and how they were assigned to each group.

H226 cell line express higher levels of VEGFR2. The effect of apatinib must be evaluated in H226 cells.\n\r\n2. LK2 cells express lower levels of VEGFR2 (almost imperceptible), these cells must represent the negative control of the effect of apatinib, however, LK2 cells behavior are similar to A549 cells, in fact, LK2 cells are more sensitive to apatinib and radiotherapy (LK2 cells showed higher levels of apoptosis and lower clonogenic survival). Radiotherapy is able to induce the expression of several membranal receptors to promote survival, its important that authors evaluate the expression of VEGFR2 after treatment of radiotherapy, apatinib or both (as figure 5) to explain the similar results between both cells. These results must explain the effect of apatinib on NSCLC cells.

This is especially an issue since they showed its expression is high in both LUAD and LUSC patients (1A and B), but dont show the PGM5 expression in LUSC in the later experiments. There are some grammatical errors in the manuscript. Please have them proofread before final submission. ", "In their report, Chen et. al. analyses the expression of hsa-miR-1293 in lung adenocarcinoma tumors and explore its potential functional role on proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cell. They finally provides In vitro and In vivo evidence that hsa-miR-1293 targets PGM5 gene, which is proposed as a plausible molecular mechanism trough which exerts its anti-neoplastic roles\n\r\nOverall, the manuscript conforms to Journal's standards. It is well written, with a clear syntax and professional style. Justification for the study is properly established in the background and intro. Some minor details I still detect, includes few misspellings and syntax errors along the text, which I would invite the authors to revise. Some of them can be located in lines 27, 53, 54, 248. \n\r\nIn general, data provided in the form of figures and supplementary data are useful and makes it easier for the reader to follow the results and findings. An exception to this is Figure 1. I understand  some of these plots have been automatically generated by the online bioinformatics resources reviewed by the authors. Still, quality of images are of low resolution and plot titles and legends are very difficult to read. This aspect might be improved. Perhaps, authors might consider distributing plots into two separated figures. Methodology is properly described, in line with the research question and objectives. \n\r\nFor the greatest part, procedures are described with sufficient detail an providing information for further replication. However, a minor number of procedures/findings require further description or improved clarity in order to fully permit other researchers replicate authors findings \n\r\nRegarding the Bioinformatics analysis section. Here, authors claim the have employed three resources (i.e., Starbase, GEPIA2 and Linkedomics), nonetheless, in the paragraph beginning at line 182 of their results, they mention that \"TargetScan\" and a dataset \"GSE118370\", were also explored. I consider, details about what these resources are (e.g., Version, study design of dataset, etc), how they were retrieved should be briefly described in methods section. \n\r\nOn this same aspect, results description and discussion in line 273 could be improved, given that in its current state remains somewhat ambiguous. With particular regard to the sentence \"Venn diagram was used to predict the target genes of miR-1293 from three independent database\" in line 187, which I fear does not exactly convey what the authors intended, which I believe is the fact that they looked at the intersection of the results from 3 different exploration strategies to find putative miRNA targets (i,e., bioinformatic prediction of seed regions, evidence of anti correlation in expression, etc). In this context, venn diagram simply serves the purpose of visual representation.\n\r\nAnother point of discussion regards the functional studies. H1299 cell line was used to study the regulation exerted by miR-1293 over PGM5 expression and  H1975 cell line was used instead to perform functional studies in vivo. A brief discussion of the rationale behind this decisions would add value the research. I consider that the characterization of of miR-1293 expression alteration and its roles at suppressing proliferation, migration and invasion of LUAD cells and its anti tumorigenic potential are well established and supported by the underlying data in this study. The discussion unfolds concisely and conclusions are congruous with original research question and restricted to the observations and supporting results.

", "The experimental study by Jian-Gan et al. has been designed to investigate the action of Glucosylceramide synthase (GSC), in the regulation of hepatocyte repair after concanavalin A-induced immune-mediated liver injury,  using 7-9-week-old pathogen-free male C57BL/6 mice. The authors performed an experimental design by GCS siRNA transfection before Con A administration. Authors report that administration of GSC in mice on Con A injection downregulated the hepatic expression of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10.  Moreover, the authors also report that administration of GCS reduced ALT, AST levels. Authors conclude that GCS inhibition reduces Con A-induced immune-mediated liver injury in mice, which may be due to the involvement of GCS in the hepatocyte repair process after injury.

"], "12058": ["Although the manuscript is generally written in an understandable way I strongly recommend re-reading of the entire text (e.g. by someone other than the Authors, preferably a native English speaker) to help point out and improve the weaker sentences (and some grammar mistakes) that are used throughout the manuscript, and which make understanding of some ideas unnecessarily difficult. For example, some of the sentences are constructed in a too simplified way, to the point that they are lacking the crucial words: (line 68) \u201cHydrogen Sulfide (H2S) is an unpleasant smell with toxicity (Lindenmann et al., 2010).\u201d I would expect the Authors to describe H2S as e.g. \u201cgas\u201d, \u201ccompound\u201d etc.. Other examples: \u201cthe total amount of 1 OD600 cells were harvested\u201d, \u201cH2S is able to resist oxidative stress\u201d, \u201cmany antibiotics also trigger the production of ROS when they targeting inhibit their targets\u201d, etc. Such sentences should therefore be expanded to clarify the meaning, increase the accuracy, and make the text easier to read (fluency).\n\r\nMoreover, in the example with H2S, in the aqueous environment (depending on the pH) HS- species may also be found [e.g., Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is readily water soluble, and, at physiological pH, about two-thirds exists as hydrogen sulfide ion (HS\u2014) and one-third as undissociated H2S; Reiffenstein et al. (1992).]. I would expect the Authors to provide more detail on the chemistry of H2S/HS- in the cells/culture fluids/culture gases, as this is vital to the understanding of the methodology used in the study. The potential presence of H2S/HS- and analysis of their concentration both as gas and in the aqueous phase should also be reflected in the Materials&Methods section.\r\nThe Authors provide some data on cys operon regulation based on the Salmonella typhimurium example (lines 73-74). Is there any data on Aeromonas species regarding this matter? If not, I would encourage Authors to indicate that, as this is likely to increase the novelty of the study.\n\r\nDividing the information provided in the Introduction section into (more) paragraphs is likely to be beneficial. For example, it is not clear whether the information about the function of Clb relates only to Salmonella typhimurium or it is a more general fact. If it is the latter case, the information about Clb should be provided in a new paragraph.\n\r\nFigure 2 B  - negative values on y axis (concentration) should not be present\n\r\nFigure 4 A \u2013 it is difficult to observe the differences in microbial growth between the plates (low resolution/contrast) Generally, in the Materials and Methods section, please add information about the number of replicates and the controls used in each of the experiments.\n\r\n\u201cLB/M9 media\u201d - although these are typical growth media, I suggest providing more detail on their exact composition, as this often differs between manufacturers.\n\r\nAs mentioned above - regarding H2S detection - there is always the problem of HS- remaining in the medium. This very much depends on the pH and as such, the pH should be monitored at all times (was it?).\n\r\nWere the Pb(Ac)2 paper strips submerged in the culture for 48 h, or were they wetted with the culture fluids after 48 h? Paper strip-tests tend to be more qualitative or semi-quantitative than other analytical tests. Please provide more detail about the strips used, including clear information about interpretation of the results (especially about quantitative comparison of the H2S/HS- yields based on color changes).\n\r\nMore details about the Cbl protein complementation procedure should also be provided in the Materials&Methods section.\n\r\nTukey\u2019s test (named in the Figures) should be mentioned in the statistical analysis section. \u201cthe absence of SmpB enhanced the synthesis of H2S\u201d\r\nHave the Authors performed any experiments to further explain this phenomenon? \r\nPotentially, SmpB is a repressor of the cys operon, which helps to limit the production of potentially toxic H2S. H2S may be a byproduct produced at stationary phase, due to the lack of down-regulation provided by SmpB. Although this is quite crucial, this matter is only vaguely explained.\n\r\nIs cysB transcription also up-regulated as a result of smpB deletion? There is no information about the transcription level of this crucial gene in the text or Figures.\n\r\nThe conclusions should be more focused on the outcomes of the study, and the parts about pathogenic strains and antibiotic resistance, which are not directly the object of the study should be a part of the discussion. The title is a little misleading, as the Cbl affects H2S (as presented in Figure 3) regardless of SmpB presence/deletion. Of course the deletion of SmpB is a special case in which the role of Cbl may be more prominent.

Overall, there has been an effect on mortality as described line 90, but there may be potential effects on other variables as well that will affect the mean of the whole treatment in a way that other treatments were not affected (e.g. maybe a stress event like that would have long lasting effects on condition factor of survivors? etc.). I think there could be more discussion about other potential impacts from this compromise of the water, to reassure the reader that any effects seen in the data involving the NH treatment really were caused by parental dietary differences, and not the compromised water. line 23 and 351: is this range actually provided somewhere? The only reference to the normal range of a phenotype variable I could find was about plasmatic concentrations and hepatic free glucose content on line 293-294. I think it would be useful to add some more references and discussion to show the reader that the many other variables (e.g. cholesterol, lipids etc.) for offspring of the fish fed more carbohydrates are also within the normal range for salmonids, in order to make sure the findings mentioned in the abstract (line 23) and discussion (line 351) are valid. line 81-82: please provide a reference for this statement\n\r\nline 215: I think the first \"HH\" here is meant to be \"NN\".

It should be discussed somewhere how species with internal development should be affected much more than species that broadcast spawn. \n\r\nline 257-262: this section is confusing. This seems to be the first mention of a Saprolegnia infection, I think this should be clearly mentioned earlier, e.g. the methods or results. Also, was this infection only in one treatment/tank, or spread evenly among the treatments? If it was spread evenly, then it shouldn't affect the experimental comparisons. It may, however, affect the inferences possible from the study (i.e. the results are only applicable to trout that have undergone such an infection, and different results may occur in an aquaculture system free from this infection). There should also be discussion about this possibility.\n\r\nline 305-306: which particular stress are you talking about here?\n\r\nline 322: it seems an interesting result that if you reduce the protein content of the diet of the parents, then this will cause a relative increase in tissue protein content of the offspring, and this result I think may be of significance for the value of the aquaculture product.

The abstract is relatively short and could probably be expanded with some more details of specific results; maybe a potentially important result such as this could be one such addition to the abstract.\n\r\nline 337: I guess it means here that if the mother and father are both from a given high/low protein treatment, then effects will be greater than if only one was.

About the experimental design, I have some points to the authors answer:\n\r\n1. I would like to understand the reasons why the authors used 72 hours to measure citotoxicity. Isn't it to high for cell culture citotoxicity evaluation?   \n\r\n2. The authors used 24 hours for flow citometry measure, 48 hours for MMP activity determination and 72 hours for cell viability. Please, justify the reasons. \n\r\n3. The authors atribute the anti tumor activities to galangin and apigenin. However, the EAEP fingerprint observed in the figure 5 b, showed other important peaks around the minutes 43-45. Galangin and apigenin are easily available in the market and the authors used them to construct the calibration curve. Why the author didn't used the isolated compound to test their hypothesis? \n\r\n4. Considering that the authors possess an HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS, why don't identify the other peaks present in the EAEP? Especially considering that other compounds maybe be present in amounts closer to galangin and apigenin in the fraction (figure 5b), and probably can contribute the the findings, it is important to identify then.\n\r\n5. Considering the solvents used in the extraction process, can the authors provide evidences about the lack of solvents residues in the samples tested? Or, the controls involved the presence of these solvents?\n\r\n6. In the lines 142-143 the authors inform that ethyl acetate is used as a polar organic solvent. In the lines 143-145, the authors says that is a medium polarity solvent and with minimal toxicity. Can the authors inform the reference for both information? Especially the minimum cell toxicity?\n\r\n7. Considering that the authors atribute to the EAEP powerful citotoxicity in tumor cells studied, can the authors support that this EAEP extract is safety to the normal cells? Is is very important to check the citotoxicy in at least fibroblast cells in order to attribute to this EAEP extract a powerful candidate for future in vivo studies. In the conclusions, the author attribute to the extract obtained a powerful candidate to anti tumor activities. Also, the authors discussed that other authors considered galangin and apigenin this activity.

Make it clear to readers to which class this compound belongs.\n\r\n2-) In item 6 of the \"Material & Methods\" the \"Tumor invasion assay\" assay is actually a \"Transwell migration assay\", as there is no addition of extracellular matrix (e.g. matrigel) for the cells to invade.\n\r\n3-) In item 7 of the \u201cMaterial & Methods\u201d the \u201cTumor migration assay\u201d, the most appropriate term (to avoid conflict with item 6) would be \u201cWound assay\u201d.\n\r\n4-) After correcting items 6 and 7 of the \u201cMaterial & Methods\u201d, the terms migration and invasion need to be revised throughout the text (e.g. line 252).\n\r\n5-) Describe the catalog number and the phosphorylation sites evaluated for each antibody described in item 11 of the \u201cMaterial & Methods\u201d.\n\r\n6-) The authors use the units of the drug in \"uM\" and \"umol/L\". Although the terms are synonymous, the authors must be consistent throughout the text to avoid misinterpretation by the readers.\n\r\n7-) Authors must include more details in all Figure legends. Readers need to be able to interpret the figures without having to read the entire text. For example, in Figure 1, include the description of the rationale for the study in the legend, the website links and the indication of the software. In all Figures, describe the statistical method and indicate p-values. In Figure 5D, what does the scale bar of the graph mean? Please carefully review all figure legends. ", "The manuscript entitled \u201cInvestigation of inhibition effect of daidzein on osteosarcoma cells based on experimental validation and systematic pharmacology analysis\u201d by Zhu explored the effect of daidzein on osteosarcoma and the potential molecular mechanism. The paper has been well-designed and evaluated; but some points should be improved before publication:\n\r\n1.\tSome grammatical/formatting errors must to be corrected in the entire text. \r\n2.\tRegarding the quality control of the cell line, the presence of mycoplasma was investigated in cell culture? Was cell culture negative for mycoplasma?\r\n3.\tThe IC50 values of daidzein on 143B and U2OS cells are 63.59 \u03bcmol/L and 125 \u03bcmol/L. This compound showed low potency. What is the clinical importance of this? A positive control should be include.\r\n4.\tNormal cell line (or primary cell culture) should be used to assess the selectively of daidzein.\r\n5.\tIn vitro invasion and migration assays must be carried out using non-cytotoxic concentrations. The interpretation of these assays using \u00bdIC50, IC50 and 2xIC50 is not appropriated. \r\n6.\tIn figure 1, use \u201cIN VIVO experiments\u201d instead \u201cIN VITRO experiments\u201d for xenograft model.\r\n7.\tFor all photograph from microscopy, include more details, e.g. bar scale, total amplification, etc. Add more details in all figure\u2019s legend.\r\n8.\tAdd statistical analysis in figures 2, 3 and 6. Add statistical at the legend of figure 4.\r\n9.\tThe quantification of WB figures is stimulated. Include the MW in each protein of WB.\r\n10.\tIn the experiments with overexpression of Src, the reversion is not clear. The negative control also presented more cells that are viable. I suggest you using a more sensitive assay than MTT (like annexin-V/PI staining by flow cytometry). "], "12081": ["Re: #60970\r\nThis manuscript claims that a comprehensive analysis of glycogene expression in cervical cancer tissues by the microarray expression analysis provides a possible prognostic biomarker for diagnosis of cervical carcinoma, i.e. metastatic potential, immune evasion and drug resistance.  Although further reverification on the number of cases is necessary, the data presented are useful, and the manuscript is acceptable for publication.\r\n  As indicated by authors, glycogene expression is not directly correlated with final expression of glycoconjugates, and accordingly with cell biological properties of cervical carcinoma.  The synthesis of glycoconjugates, i.e. GPI anchor, proteoglycan, glycosphingolipids, and N- and O-linked glycoproteins, is dependent on the supplies of substrate glycoconjugates and nucleotides sugars, and the enzymatic activities of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases.  In addition, the cancerous tissues are the mixtures of cells with the different proliferation- and differentiation-stages, connective tissues, blood vessels and so on.  Same as true for normal cervical tissues.  Based on the present data, further evaluation on the expression of glycoconjugates and the characterization of cervical carcinoma is required. ", "The manuscript by Mertinez-Morales et al. investigated the glycogene expression and glycosylation pathways in squamous and adenocarcinoma cervical cancer using microarrays and RNA-Seq data. The purpose of the study is rather interesting, since glycogenes still remain one of the under explored area as compared to other genes. However, there are some drawbacks in the designing, data analyses and interpretation of the results.\n\r\nThe introduction lacks a proper definition of glycogenes. In addition to the two enzymes mentioned by the authors on line 67, other types of genes are also classified as glycogenes (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10483). It should be highlighted if authors want to focus on any specific set of glycogenes.\n\r\nLine 111: Please provide mean age and standard deviation for both samples. \n\r\nThe discussion is extremely long which makes the manuscript a difficult read. It is not clear what was the aim of carrying out microarray analysis. Bulk of their results and discussion is based on the analysis of publicly available RNA-Seq datasets. Besides, the microarray platform used consists of only 10,000 genes, and therefore may comprise only a limited number of glycogenes. This might explain why only 15 glycogenes were identified as differentially expressed in their microarray dataset. It would be interesting to know how many were actually glycogenes from the list of 10,000 genes.\n\r\nAdditionally, why did authors chose Microarrays over the RNA-Seq?\n\r\nThe authors must mention the version number of databases and tools for reproducibility. For example, using the list of 6 up-regulated glycogenes I could not find any interaction between these 6 genes (interaction score = 0.9). It would have been better if the interaction network was generated using 401 glycogenes and then map the 15 genes identified from microarray onto that network.\n\r\nWhat fold change is represented by the 15 altered glycogenes? Moreover, the authors did not validate by experimental methods (e.g. RT-PCR) any of the 15 altered glycogenes.The authors should also improve on the presentation of protein-protein and pathway enrichment analyses. It is also not discussed how many out of their 15 glycogenes were also identified in RNA-Seq analysis. Reasons for any discrepancies should be discussed. Please report adjusted p-values for enrichment analyses.\n\r\nLine 220: Table Supp 2 is cited before Table Supp 1.\n\r\nFigure 2 and 3: Since the genes belong to different clusters in these figures, it is suggested authors highlight these genes (probably by different colors) in supp. Tables 1 and 2. It is difficult to follow which genes from supplementary data belong to which clusters.\n\r\nLine 265: impllicated -> implicated.\n\r\nInformation in Table 5 and supplementary tables is limited. It is recommended to include the gene/protein names and their functional annotations. The authors should look at some of the representative papers focusing on glycogene (\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013002; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-483) analyses as well as papers with PPI network and enrichment analyses (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-65909-x). This will help them to improve the manuscript substantially by properly analyzing the gene expression data. "]}
